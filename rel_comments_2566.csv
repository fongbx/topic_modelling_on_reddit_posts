For drugs, if you have young or adolescent kids, you will understand. I have friends overseas where it is so easy to obtain illicit drugs that it is a huge problem, even in university campuses. Fortunately not in Singapore. I view capital punishment as a means to an end, ie. as a deterrent, and it has been an effective one thus far. Singapore's crime rate is really very low. Huge posters that drug trafficking carries the death penalty are pasted very visibly and plainly at our airport, sea port, land crossings, etc. Announcements are made in passenger planes during landing. If people still want to flout the rules, they deserve the consequences. I have no sympathy for such. 

As for the case of the man who had low IQ who was executed because of drug trafficking, I do not have the full details of the case, but it has been reported that the court had established beyond reasonable doubt that he knew what he was doing despite his low IQ.

Singapore is mostly an echo chamber of ""Drugs are always bad"", at least from a law maker perspective. So, it is often portrayed as drug users are ""scum"" and drug traffickers ""deserves death"" because they can ""bring Singapore to its knees"".

There are a small number that don't believe in this rhetoric.

Today if we just slightly adjust our law of acceptance to cannabis, to categories it such that traffickers or abusers will not get punished as harsh. Tomorrow you'll first probably see more traffickers and slowly more abusers. And if we allow cannabis, there will be drug users who will start advocating for acceptance of other drugs. 

This is what is happening now and it's starting with cannabis. While cannabis might not be ""as severe as"" other drugs, there posses a risk of abuse. If the abuse isn't controlled it will lead to a societial down spiral. And all these control measures, all these leniency will only result greater resources to cope with these issues. 

Another example is vaping. It has greater damage than cannabis. But our youths are vaping everywhere even with law in place. Death penalty by vaping is not in place. If it's in place, you'll probably not see anyone vaping. 

It's like a rabbit hole, once you allow something, it's never going to end.

Some drugs are legal in a growing number of places now, but it is often because drug use and addiction is so widespread in society, that it is simply no longer possible to police its use, so authorities would rather just legalise it and let the medical system deal with the problem. 

It's important to understand why drug laws are often so harsh in Asia and it has its roots in the Opium Wars and the experience of China with opium in the 19th century. It destroyed one of the great ancient civilisations of the world and they still haven't recovered from it. The US is currently going through the same experience with a wide array of drugs that are destroying society and causing an unprecedented crime, homelessness, mental health and plummeting life expectancy crisis. Whatever they're doing in the US, clearly isn't working and I have some sympathy for the harsh approach that Singapore has adopted. Do you really want to be stepping over homeless drug addicts on every corner, with the associated social problems?

Even cannabis is not as benign as is often portrayed by pro-legalisation activists and users. Although you can't really overdose on it, it has been linked to psychosis and paranoid delusions.

1. Don't succumb to temptation and traffic drugs, however desperate you are for cash.

2. Mix with the right company. Don't get addicted to drugs and if you already are, go for rehab before the drugs mess with your mind so much you pretty much can't do anything except become a drug mule.

3. Don't help another person carry luggage across borders and pass it to someone else, especially if that person offers you money.

4. Don't leave your luggage unattended and lock your bags (if at the airport, make sure only you touch it until it's checked in).

3. Even if you somehow get caught by law enforcement officers with drugs in your possession, tell your officers you have no idea how that stuff came into your possession. Pickpockets can make off with an unsuspecting person's wallet easily, no doubt it's easy to plant drugs on an unsuspecting person too. Of course it will most probably not suffice to convince them, but you are still a long way away from being hanged in Changi Prison.

Once caught and charged with trafficking drugs, you'll get a lawyer under the LASCO scheme to fight your case. Tell him what happened. If you haven't got proof that you stand to make a profit from bringing the drugs in, the prosecutors will find it difficult to charge you for trafficking drugs, let alone bring you to the hangman's noose.

Meanwhile, the CNB officers and police will also work to bring you to justice. They'll check your bank accounts, e-mail and phone records and those of your suspected accomplices, their intel sources and decide whether you deserve to die from the hangman's noose.

========

How do law enforcement officers suspect a person is bringing drugs into SG?

1. Intelligence. No doubt some of the CNB officers work undercover or have moles working for them in syndicates. Your name shouldn't even be on their radar if you haven't been trafficking drugs.

2. Random checks at border crossings. If you really are caught with drugs in your possession by some conspiracy not of your own doing, you must have had a huge dose of bad luck.

=============

Based on the evidence, the public prosecutors will deliberate over whether you deserve to hang in the first place. They can choose to charge you with the amount required for you to hang, or not. The judge isn't a rubber stamp. He can choose to disagree with the prosecutors that you deserve hanging. Your counsel will do his best to clear your name in any case. 

But let's say ths prosecution decides to charge you with the death penalty, the judge will weigh both sides of the argument to determine your fate.

If you are sentenced to hang, then you would need to go to the Court of Appeal to argue your case. Round Two between your counsel and prosecution. Again, the judges will look at the evidence provided by both sides to decide your fate.

But lets say you've endured two huge miscarriages of justice, you can appeal to the President for clemency (a joke, I know, but still, it's there). 

After your clemency has been rejected, it isn't the end just yet. You'll be on death row for at least some weeks, if not years. During this period, your lawyer and loved ones still have time to find proof that you aren't involved in the drug trade until the day you take that walk to the gallows. Also, during this time, if new evidence emerges, then you can have the case re-opened, even though it's very difficult.

Until the day comes when Singapore has a corrupt judiciary (at this moment, it ranks as one of the least corrupted governments in the world), then an inmocent person should worry about getting caught. But until then, the average person entering Singapore's borders an rest relatively easily if some criminal concocts a conspiracy to have a crook plant a drug on him/her and then have another crook collect it after with him/her being none the wiser.",askSingapore,1,t1_ji1ism5

&gt;On the contrary, Singapore attracted $11.8bn in foreign direct investments last year (including from EU countries) and has benefited from a “flight to safety”. Singapore’s safe and drug-free environment is one reason why foreign investors locate themselves, their employees and families in Singapore.

&gt;Singapore imposes the death penalty on serious crimes such as intentional murder and drug trafficking. We take a strict view on drug trafficking because of the lives that it destroys.

They know of the consequences but they still chooses to go ahead. I feel in this case, the Singapore Government should not do anything, because they clearly deserve what's coming to them. 

I am for capital punishment, not that I don't value human life, but I feel every action has its consequences. No doubt in the recent headlines, they have been showing successful reforms of those drug smugglers, finding God and love for art and all. But that doesn't discount the fact that that they carried out the crime. If You want to do the crime, be prepared to do the time or pay the price.

If you flip the situation and remember that diplomat who ran over someone and got jailed, I think you'd probably remember how Singaporeans cheered over how SG DID NOT STAND for people walking over us just because they were foreigners on an immunity pass thingy. So we already somewhat know the feeling of being the country on that side. Depending on if you in general are for or against capital punishment, I think it's safe to say you'd be for or against it 'as long as it wasn't Singaporeans'. But therein lies the rub, and therein the complicated-ness, where we are now on the side of the country with people who are found guilty of committing something serious enough our own country deals death to. If it were Singaporeans in Singapore, we'd be 'yes, they deserve it'.

The complicated answer is that it's politically affected, despite the ethical answer being yes. If Singapore were to admit that they are not going to save fellow Singaporeans in another country under threat of death, it would make some locals unsafe. Best case they obey foreign laws more often, worst case they think they have no rights in foreign land because the government won't stick up for them.

On top of that, some people may or may not feel outraged that Singapore is not flexing that 'clout'. The fact that you asked how much we have is indicative that this has become, instead of an ethical debate, more of a dick-measuring contest in terms of political pull.

I agree with the capital punishment for drug traffickers.

Even with capital punishment, there are still people trying to bring drugs into Singapore. 

Why?

Because of the rewards they can get. A few kilograms of drugs can destroy hundreds to thousands of families. One death is too kind.

What if there is no capital punishment? Would there be more people willing to take the risk? Would there be more families being destroyed? 

Back in my uni days, I took a course in Ethics. I believe Singapore follow the utilitarianism philosophy (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism) - their actions are right if they are useful or for the benefit of the majority.

Retribution. Eye for an eye. You kill someone with cold blooded intent, you get hung. 

Deterrence. Knowing that a particular offence can lead to your death will dissuade many. So yeah death penalty is effective to dissuade crimes right? 

No. I am not sure how many of you guys have worked in the prisons, SPF and CNB or are lawyers or social workers, but if you do, you will know that drug traffickers/mules are usually poor folk trying to make some money to pay off debts or medical bills. I met a drug trafficker once at Changi Prison. He was from Malaysia, convicted of drug trafficking. I was interning at a law firm at that time and I followed my boss there. So this guy has an elderly father who needs an emergency surgery for his eyes. Dude has not enough money to pay for operation. And it is Malaysia. So no choice, he trafficks. I actually asked him why he did it. And he told me he had no choice. There was no other way to get that amount of money in the quickest time.

Moral of the story: death penalty is not going to deter those who have nothing to lose. That is why we see people continuing to traffick.

For murder, there are those who do it because they have lost all sense of rationality. You cannot deter those people. You also cannot deter morons who act on impulse and think later.

I am for the death penalty but its application should be less rigid and the scope, narrower. Drug mules are not the problem. Drug syndicates are. There will always be drug mules so as long as poverty exists. Kill one and another takes his place.

If you're visiting or even transiting at Singapore, here's what I recommend you do before you fly.

1. Ensure you know the exact contents of your luggage and carry on bag. Not knowing what is in your luggage is not an excuse / defense against drug trafficking.
2. Once you landed, check that your carry on bag is not tampered with. Just do a brief check and ensure everything is in place and there's no hidden slits anywhere.
3. After you passed immigration and collected your luggage, check that it is not tampered with. If you find that someone has tampered with it, DO NOT open the luggage. Instead, find the customs officer (usually they are the AETOS security) and tell them you suspect someone has tampered with the luggage. Tell them you haven't open the luggage at all and request at least one official ICA customs officer (not AETOS security) to be present while they go through the ""tampered"" luggage. If they do find something, then be prepared to be delayed for a few hours to answer all their questions on where you come from, when's the last time you touch your bag and so on. Your luggage may be confiscated as evidence.
4. As long you don't pass the ""Green/Red"" customs and you declare anything suspicious as soon as you retrieve the luggage, you shouldn't be prosecuted.
5. Also take note that once you report the luggage for suspicious tampering, the authorities have the responsibility of checking whether the luggage contains any other fingerprints that does not belong to you. Please ensure that happens as it will be the most important evidence to say that the drug's not yours.

Extra tips for those who are really worried: If you are really afraid that shit may hit the fan, go and download this app made by the government of Singapore. It's called SGSecure (com.ministryofhomeaffairs.sgsecure.mhasg). Before you check in, take a photo of the luggage checked in with the person / machine that processed your check in. When you landed, if you feel that someone had tampered with your luggage, take a photo immediately and upload the tampered luggage photo onto SGSecure. Always cover your asses.

The toughest part is not about who to report to or what to do when such a situation happens. Of course, everyone is encouraged to report any illicit items they find in their belongings to the authorities immediately.

The main focus in this type of scenarios would be the manner in which you prove to the Judge how the drugs got there, and why they were there. This is because the Judge is acting on the law of possession, as well as because of the obvious fact that he was not there at the time someone possibly planted drugs in your belongings, so you have to convince him/her.

The 2 bundles turned out to be heroin, and the mule has claimed that he was just helping a friend that he met in Malaysia bring some stuff back to Singapore.

Let's start with: What happens if they find drugs in your luggage.

Under the misuse of drugs act:

&gt; Any person who is proved or presumed to have had a
controlled drug in his possession shall, until the contrary is
proved, be presumed to have known the nature of that drug.

So, you will need to prove that either:

* You have no idea what that is
* You thought it was something else
* You didn't have ""possession""

From the very next part after the judge quotes the misuse of drugs act on ""knowledge"".

&gt; When an accused person like Dominic is presumed to have knowledge,
he can seek to rebut the presumption. He can inter alia plead ignorance, that
he did not know what the bundles were, or he can plead mistake, that he
believed them to be something else.

Ultimately, the accused admitted to a psychiatrist that he knew that he was importing drugs, even though during trial, he claimed that he was lying.

&gt; While the admission that he knew they were drugs falls
short of proof of knowledge of diamorphine, he was presumed to have the
knowledge under s 18(2), and **he failed to present credible evidence to rebut
the presumption on a balance of probabilities.**

But China is cracking down on this to some extent too because it's a very significant (but completely painless) concession it can take up with United States over the trade war. So many people in the US are dying to opioid addictions that it is one of the only 3 countries in the world that has a declining life expectancy (along wtih Afghanistan and Syria).

Hence, the carfentail (and the other powerful synthetic opioids) problem is almost exclusively an American problem because of the widespread prescriptions of addictive opioid pain medications like oxycontin and the other -contin drugs which acted as a gateway for opioid addictions.

We do not have this problem because our physicians never prescribed opioid medications on that scale as American physicians who were so open to bribery-in-all-but-name by pharmaceutical firms. Besides, carfentail's lethality (its dose-lethality is equivalent to Sarin) makes it unviable for commercialization as a illicit street drug because of the high potential for mistakes. One slip up from illicit drug manufacturers will end up killing all their customers. And lots of dead people tends to attract massive attention from authorities, even in the more laissez faire countries, therefore it's a largely unprofitable enterprise. Fentanyl is also potent but less lethal, but its potential for overdose deaths is still so high. The same logic applies to an extent for manufacturers and dealers.

Ergo, our drug problem really is that small. 3k arrests a year is nothing. Drug abuse is not a highly distributed issue in Singapore (compared to the US, where it's a problem across thousands of rustbelt towns across the country), but rather tends to be clustered in very small groups. Arrests are almost always for recalcitrant offenders. I mean, how many Singaporeans have actually even seen illicit drug abuse personally? Personally, I've never seen any.

3.  You note that the number of people executed in Singapore has reduced greatly (till the last 2 years though, I must point out), and indeed, most of them are drug-related. This sounds like there are less and less people slammed with the death penalty.
4. Seized heroin are found to be reduced in purity. You argue that greater crackdown should by right increase purity to evade capture
5. You propose that our drugs are being tainted with synthetic opoids, and that will explain the fewer death penalties (not enough heroin to be given death penalty) and reduced purity (synthetic opoids substitute the 'kick' from heroin)
6. Your point ultimately is that the more the govt cracks down, the more crime lords will evolve to evade resulting in greater effort needed by the govt, as conceptualized in Darwinism 

At this point I must declare that I am no expert in drug crime (nor anything related im afraid), and while I made the effort to open my laptop to type this response out I do not have nearly the same amount of time to research this topic as intensely as you did. Hence some of my responses will be questions which I hope you help enlighten me.

1. Let's address the ambassador's statement since it made up a third of your post. While you argue that he 'left out' the part about drug abusers nabbed increasing in recent years, I must argue in defence of his honour that a) his statement did not contain any falsehoods, not was intended to mislead. Number of arrests did decrease in those 2 timeframes he provided, and while it increased recently, it never exceeded 2017 numbers by a great margin (there was no hidden giant peak that he omitted). His point still stands that our anti-drug efforts remain sufficient to curb drug abuse, especially against the background of an opoid epidemic in the US (You and I can agree to disagree on this). b) Number of arrests is an iffy thing. It does not signify that drug abuse went up. It could also be due in part to increasing efforts by CNB to nab drug abusers, and we know that they are taking great lengths to do so what with the frequent islandwide and border operations, and the advancements in technology making it easier for them to nab abusers. An enforcement agency with an increasing efficiency will naturally see its arrest numbers go up. 2018 Drug Report claims 26 drug syndicates dismantled, 1600 operations. We will never know how much each factor (crime level/efficiency) comes into play.
2. You questioned CNB about the price of drugs, and received 'unsatisfactory' answers. Please put this out for us to judge, if they did not instruct you to keep it privy.
3. Executions dropped. A lot. I have no idea why.  [https://singaporelegaladvice.com/death-penalty-singapore/](https://singaporelegaladvice.com/death-penalty-singapore/)  says since 2012 death penalty has been eased a little bit. But it still doesnt account for the drops prior to 2012. Last year had a sharp rise to 13, though. That's higher than any year all the way back to at least 2003. I have no data on how many death sentences were meted, so I cannot say whether the number of drug traffickers reduced, or whether less are getting the death penalty, as you use for the basis of your argument I highlighted above in pt 5. Even if death penalty is being meted less, we must consider that, as I linked above, we are not so excited in dishing out death penalties anymore. 
4. Regarding that 'purity went down' article, yes it did mention that, but from what time point? 1970s? Or 1990s? This is an important piece of missing info. If you have access to the full article, do share what it says. 
5. Anyways, so purity of drugs did go down, and you flagged it to be against theoretical reasoning. Well, I must say this can have multiple reasons. Most likely imo, drug syndicates here operate on much smaller scales, and hence peddle low purity drugs to reduce detection (recall that CNB can dismantle dozens of syndicates EVERY YEAR consistently) Contrary to what you have in mind, I think that there is no one big Escobar-like mafia syndicate running huge drug operations locally bringing in high-purity drugs. If you have any counter information, please enlighten me.
6. By the way, heroin only accounts to one-fifth of abuse cases, not one-third.
7.  This is where I need a little bit of personal info from you. Do you have a biochemistry background? I studied a little of this kinda stuff, and I can tell you that based on the analytical instruments that the study used (I went to the wiley website and downloaded their supporting info), GC-MS and HPLC, these are VERY VERY sensitive instruments capable of detecting trace amounts of ANYTHING. I would like to hence argue that if there WAS synthetic opoids in there, they probably would have highlighted it. Your casual sentence in another comment ""However, if CNB labs aren't testing for them, they can't find it."" hence do not hold so much weight too. They probably are using the same instruments, that can detect these chemicals without looking for them. Yes, no matter how potent they are, if its enough to give you a high, it will show up on the machines. I wonder if you asked CNB about this though, because im interested in their response about this
8. OK. So to summarize, I criticize your article in the following ways 1) Our ambassador was right 2) Your synthetic opoid hypotheis does not hold water, WITHOUT the following information a) That more drug traffickers are indeed being caught with less than 15g heroin, b) that purity of drugs are indeed decreasing recently but local abusers are still satisfactorily high, and c) there are synthetic opoids in our drugs
9. Bonus: you talked about budget in another comment. I must argue that 120 million dollars for 1 out of 9 home team agencies which collectively spends more than 5 billion dollars is chump change. And using street values to flaunt seizures are perfectly reasonable: These are money that the syndicate is SUPPOSED to earn, which can be used to expand their operations, but now they cant, aka opportunity cost. When we report thieves stealing things from shops, we report their value in retail price, not cost price right?

&amp;#x200B;

Now, for a little public education talk.

Why do we need drug laws?

Drug laws work. Drug laws tell the society that abusing drugs is NOT okay and IT IS NOT OKAY to abuse drugs. If we legalized drugs, the number of abusers WILL skyrocket, and we wont even need to be discussing about 6k and 3k abusers anymore, and the sg economy will be in deep shit. With drug laws and an enforcement agency, we keep drug peddlers and abusers on their toes, and importantly we deter global drug syndicates. Syndicates in singapore are likely to be locally run, each made up of less than a dozen people. We do not have big overseas organisations trying to earn money off selling drugs to singaporeans because 1) we have so few abusers, 2) its so much hassle having our government breathe down their neck. And both of these are credited to - TADA - drug laws!

t1,eklr0a8,t3_bbuoxm,2019-04-11 03:26:50,goondoo7,"Here is the March 2018 letter from Singapore's US ambassador to WaPo that you mentioned as being paywalled:

&gt; Regarding the March 2 news article “At opioids summit, Trump suggests executing dealers to help end crisis”:

&gt; Singapore is one of the few countries that have kept drug abuse under control. We take a clearheaded approach.

&gt; We invest significant efforts to prevent drug abuse. The government works closely with community groups, parents and teachers to educate youths and the general public on the harm and consequences of drug abuse. Drug abusers undergo compulsory rehabilitation programs to help them kick their drug habits. Upon release from rehabilitation centers, ex-abusers receive help to reintegrate into society. Tough laws and effective enforcement are a strong deterrent against drug sales and consumption. Stiff penalties punish those who disregard the law and deter others.

&gt; Singapore’s anti-drug strategy has worked well. Singapore has one of the lowest rates of drug abuse in the world: 30 opiates abusers per 100,000 people, compared with 600 in the United States. The U.S. opioid crisis has been declared a public-health emergency; 64,000 died from drug overdoses in the United States in 2016. In the 1990s, Singapore arrested more than 6,000 drug abusers annually. By 2016, this number had gone down to about 3,000.

&gt; Any suggestion that Singapore’s judicial process is “shrouded in secrecy and misinformation” is inaccurate. Cases are tried in open court and are reported. The death penalty is imposed only for the most serious offenses, including drug trafficking. Singapore does not take joy in the death penalty. But Singaporeans understand the need for it and strongly support it.

&gt; When expressing sympathy for drug traffickers, let us remember the immense harm drugs cause abusers and their families, especially children.

t1,eklrhqe,t3_bbuoxm,2019-04-11 03:33:51,DuePomegranate,"You have some interesting points, but

1) You really shouldn't link to someone's Masters thesis and slam it like that. The guy's name is there for all to see. And it is perfectly correct that a thesis that's just good enough to get a Masters should be failed by a PhD committee.

2) It is completely unclear what you want to happen. CNB isn't hiding anything, the data is all there. CNB can't stop the ambassador from ""selling"" Singapore; it's his job to be a ""salesman"" and any salesman would praise the good points of his product and hide the bad points.

The number of executions has gone down. I don't think Singapore wants to execute more drug traffickers. Do you want the laws to be changed so that it's easier to execute traffickers if they combine less heroin with fentanyl/carfentanil?

The number of drug users did indeed go down and then back up. That CNB demographic profile page shows that this is primarily due to the ever-increasing numbers of methamphetamine users, from \~100 in 2005 to 2000+ in 2018. Meanwhile, heroin users grew from 2005 to 2012 (2000+), then crashed to 700 in 2018.

So I don't know much about the world of drugs, but I posit to you that focusing on heroin is a red herring. Perhaps the price crashed because users shifted over to meth, and the demand dropped. Meanwhile, on the supply side, they decreased the purity of the heroin and thus the production cost. Maybe the level of ""high"" remained the same because they added the synthetics. Maybe they didn't (the paper about purity mentioned caffeine and chloroquine as the main adulterants), the ""high"" became unsatisfactory, and users switched to meth. 

I don't actually know any drug users, but presumably, CNB has people on the ground who have an eye on the situation. Going to CNB and asking them questions with the apparent attempt to get them to admit that they aren't doing a great job (?) isn't going to spur them on to do better.

All of the data I used in in the public domain; some have since been rescinded since I contacted the CNB over my interpretation of it.

It is generally difficult to trust any research or data supplied by the government or indeed by anyone affiliated with any local university, if it is on a subject that is even remotely political/historical. The subject of drugs is certainly a sensitive area.

If we were to compare drug laws &amp; enforcement in US vs SG, we can see that previously trafficking routes used to take the eastern maritime and air route into the US via the Caribbean into Florida. But a crackdown on that route led to a shift towards the western overland/underground routes. A shift which ultimately makes halting their movement much harder. This means that drug abuse levels would then be arguable higher, and a contributing factor towards how the US now treats drug abuse--managing drug abuses over hard halting it--which can be seen in several states having needle bins and such. 

&amp;#x200B;

In SG's context, I would argue that as a island-state, prevent trafficking is much easier relatively speaking. Which allows us to keep drug abuse levels at much lower levels, thus justifying our strict stance towards drug abuse. If we are capable of halting the drug abuse/trafficking , then we have no need to shift our policy as severely towards managing the abusers.",singapore,1,t1_ekpibui

&gt; SINGAPORE - A 29-year-old man was found guilty on Wednesday (July 13) of murdering his then girlfriend's nine-month-old son in 2019, after the High Court rejected his defence that the baby's death was an accident.

&gt; Mohamed Aliff Mohamed Yusoff claimed that he was holding the baby, Izz Fayyaz Zayani Ahmad, in his arm and trying to close the door of his van when the baby fidgeted and fell head-first onto the floorboard of the van before falling on the ground.

&gt; However, High Court judge Mavis Chionh concluded that it was Aliff who had caused the fatal head injuries to Izz by pushing his head against the floorboard of the van.

&gt; Justice Chionh found that Aliff's claim of an accidental fall was not consistent with autopsy findings and medical opinion.

&gt; Senior consultant forensic pathologist Gilbert Lau found that the baby had died from bleeding in the brain as a result of traumatic injury.

&gt; Dr Lau testified that if Izz had indeed fallen with sufficient impact to have suffered the fatal internal injuries, he would have expected to find some laceration or linear abrasion of the skull - but he found no such thing.

&gt; In his statements to the police, Aliff vacillated between admitting to having pushed Izz's head against the floorboard of the van and claiming that Izz had hit his head after accidentally falling from his arm.

&gt; When Dr Lau was presented with the various versions of events, he testified that the version in which Aliff admitted to pushing Izz's head against the floorboard twice was most consistent with his autopsy findings.

&gt; The incident took place between 10pm on Nov 7, 2019 and 12.15am on Nov 8, 2019 at a carpark in Yishun Street 81.

&gt; Justice Chionh said Aliff's conduct after the incident supported the version that he had intentionally pushed Izz's head against the floorboard.

&gt; Aliff's then girlfriend, Ms Nadiah Abdul Jalil, said he had suggested to her that they pay someone to bury Izz and report him missing a year later.

&gt; Ms Nadiah said Aliff repeatedly delayed taking her and Izz to the National University Hospital accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department.

&gt; After parking at the NUH basement carpark, Aliff took time to brush his teeth and wipe his body; Ms Nadiah testified that he told her this was because he feared being placed in remand by the police.

&gt; She also testified that Aliff made her wait while he took time to dispose of his mobile phone before eventually taking her to the A&amp;E department.

1) **History of drug in Asia** - In the turn of 19 century, the British seek to control China, one them is via getting a significant number of the local populace of addicted to opium, a highly addictive drug that create a huge withdrawn symptoms for the user. 

This heavily impact China's economy and increase their vulnerability towards the encroaching Western powers, as well as losing productivity with an addicted workforce, reduce internal monetary circulation when all worker's income goes to drugs and forced to keep trade channels favourable to the British. Which sequently lead to the [Opium Wars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium_Wars), when China tried to clamp down on this, which also began to create cracks for downfall for Dynastic rule in China.

Being a large exporter of foreign workers, many Asian countries that have large population of Chinese workers witness the first hand of the destruction caused by these drugs, as these lead to rise of secret societies and active gang wars in their own nation.

2) **Turbulent times** - A significant number of Asian countries gain their independence either by force or peaceful means from Western powers after hundred years of colonisation. 

And usually these new governments that form have the common traits of being authoritarian, revolutionaries or populist, in order to strengthen their grip on power by the power vacuum left by Western powers, they usually tried to stamp any potential source of instabilities, since they have the fresh memories of China's dynastic downfall which give fuel to a deadly civil war, crimes involving drugs are heavily punished. 

And is not like they have a good reason to have a favourable view on the West and their ideals, especially all the trouble and oppression they have caused. This lead to many Asian countries having harsh punishment against drug, including keeping the death penalty as an additional deterrence. 

Singapore was no different, we were lead by a government who on a tough on crime platform, facing potential threats such as Communist takeover and aggression from the Islamic neighbours, the government had to deliver the result and combat any threats.

3) **Successful authoritarian government model** - If you look at many political commentary about Singapore that may decry about Singapore's horrible civil rights record (Not that ""bad"", if you seen our neighbours.), they cannot deny the citizens mostly trust the government and government in the end delivered the economic success for their citizens.

So whatever the government say, we generally trust them or at least follow their lead enough. Which sadly includes the death penalty.

Because the other alternative is being more democratic but risk a more corrupted and less effective government (there is very little good democratic role models in the SEA region).

4) **More conservative** - Due to our position as this impossible tiny nation that thrive in the middle of region known for unstability, our government and our political views are typically more risk averse and avoid trying to trying rock the social order. 

Because our fear is the balance to economic success is on a tightrope, a wrong mistep can end our economic progress as we rely heavily on being the image of being safe and a good place to setup your business in despite being more expensive and smaller.",askSingapore,31,t1_j8phlrk

So, as I said, I get asked this or a variation of this question a lot. My standard response is to relate the story of Sunny Ng, who killed his wife (for the insurance payout) by sabotaging her diving equipment so that it would look like a diving accident. I think the Sunny Ngs of the world deserve to die and in this case the death penalty gives me a sense of justice that a long term imprisonment would not. I do not buy the argument that a long term imprisonment is a worse punishment than death, for if given the choice, I believe it is few people that would choose death over imprisonment. I also think that yes, everyone makes mistakes, but certain actions are beyond redemption.

I think the where the crime is drug trafficking, and the trafficker is but a mule, I can sympathise more with arguments opposing the death penalty. But if we agree that Sunny Ng should die, then the question really isn't 'Is the death penalty necessary'. The question then becomes, for which crimes should the death penalty apply.

TLDR: You could say I support the death penalty for the most egregious crimes because it provides a sense of justice.

I think from all the comments here, you can tell that most people justify the use of death penalty cause it is a “good deterrence”, however there are so many gaps in this argument

Firstly, we don’t have enough data to show that it is a good deterrence. Many people including Shanmugam would point that number of drug traffickers decrease so it is effective, but correlation does not equal causation. There is a need to compare the numbers against factors like price of drugs, changes in geographical distribution, etc. Also despite having death penalty, there is still drug traffickers, which point out we have not tackled both the supply and demand of drugs.

Secondly, many argue also that it is a good deterrence because drugs are dangerous and destroy life and we are punishing those people, I.e., fair and effective punishment, why are we not implementing or even opening discussion about death penalty on other crimes like rape, abuse, child molestation, etc. those crimes also harm people and I would even argue that the effects are more long term than drugs. Whenever I brought up this point, they would give excuses like “oh we worry that the rapist would murder and there would be no witness”. So a rapist will hide evidence but drug traffickers too dumb to hide evidence? This excuse also undermined our police implying that they not able to solve the crime. They point out the flaw behind death penalty but will not admit that death penalty is flawed

For me, I still think we should keep death penalty, but have it as an option for other serious crimes as well. Then if they want to evoke death penalty, the lawyer has to argue why the death penalty should be used (maybe to an independent board).

So the question to answer is, if a right can be taken away, is it even a right in the first place or just a privilege granted if you conform to certain behaviour.

Now there are arguments about how you protect society from people who would threaten the rights of others, if one person takes away these rights forcefully from another then you have to have a mechanism to protect society, but killing someone isn't a necessity to do this, there are plenty of other options.

Then further into this philosophical discussion you get to the tyranny of the majority. What a majority or large group of any given society considers worthy of punishment can often take away human rights of minority groups even though they are not infringing anybody else's rights.

For instance 100 years ago in many countries, just being Gay was enough to carry a death sentence, you could be exercising your right to life, love with another consenting person and yet society was prepared to kill you for that.

I personally think the case for death penalty is for deterrence and protection of the people resources. I am gonna focus more on drugs since death penalty is seldom dealt for other cases such as murder in Singapore.

**Deterrence**

If you watch videos of captured drug smugglers on how drug cartels work in the modern era, it always involve a local team to spread the drugs, while the cartels figure out how to bring drugs into the country. The point of deterrence is not to catch the local peddlers or the paid drug importers, but to prevent a path setup as home base. This of course depends on alot more factors than just death penalty, but a interviewed drug lord has said the main 2 criteria is 1. how heavy the death penalty is and 2. can you bribe your way through in the country. Deterrence also works as a fear factor to local people, but the less you have to lose, the less you give a damn about the rules anyway.

**Protection of people resource**

This might be a uniquely Singapore, or rather a small country problem. We don't have much natural resources, and people resource is the most important of all the resources we have. When it comes to drugs, especially addictive drugs like opioids, it's a matter of access not a matter of who uses it. In a high stress environment like Singapore, it's even more dangerous with studies pointing stress correlation to drug abuse vulnerability. All these points towards diminishing important human resources and human resources affects GDP directly. It's not that hard to imagine why Singapore isn't going to remove the death penalty just on this point alone.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all, I believe death penalty works as its meant to in Singapore, especially Singapore.

The question instead of ""Is death penalty right/wrong/should be supported or not etc"", I'd like to rephrase it into ""Should the government have the power to wield the right to execute."" 

 Singapore in the global view are seen as a gentle/soft/kind dictatorship. Our opposition still has a long way to go before winning the election, our media is completely censored and there are many rules that dictate personal freedom of rights. 

The tool to execute therefore becomes problematic because our government CAN be problematic. In short, you're giving an imperfect government an irreversible tool. You're also ASSUMING the government has the right to judge the term of a person's mortality. 

In a perfect world, under a perfect government, one can argue the right to execute wouldn't exist or even if it did, it would be used flawlessly to end evil. But our death penalty is solely used for drug traffickers. 

To answer my question, no, i don't think it is wise as the common people to allow the government to wield an irreversible tool considering the value of a life cannot be quantified simply based on utilitarian measure (e.g. kill 5 offenders or 1 president). 

This brings me to my point by which these offenders are victims of circumstances. Think of the profiles of drug mules or traffickers. These are people desperate for money. Many Singaporeans can't even relate closely to how harsh their conditions is. Growing up in slums, having to feed your family, or worse would be growing up in the cartel already being subjugated to violence and drug use on a daily basis. If these traffickers go back wirhout the money, they'll be killed. If these traffickers get caught by the government, they'll be killed. These are NOT always evil people, but people being born into evil circumstances. They're a result of failed and corrupted governance and we are executing them. The research clearly shows there's a strong causal effect between poverty rates and crime rates. People in desperate situations act desperately. They should take ownership of their actions but they cannot because they'll be executed either way.  Having amnesty program would go a longer way to helping rehabilitate traffickers and our citizens RATHER than using the iron hand and cracking down on them. 

If the question is how can we best stop drug traffickers, Singapore can definitely learn from Scandinavian countries adopting amnesty programs for drug users and drug traffickers because our current way isn't the ONLY way.",askSingapore,2,t1_i6ejgfs

&gt;Obviously I understand that is is easier for the pro death penalty camp since the government puts out arguments and data on their behalf.


It's interesting that you mention that, because from where I stand it's actually looks like it's very much the opposite. The only arguments that I hear from the pro-death penalty side are either very poorly thought out emotional appeals (*what if it's your family member?*), completely irrelevant (*the law is this, so it must be done* - I'd like to add that while this is a good argument for why the law should be followed, it isn't an argument for the law itself), or has no backing whatsoever in any data or statistics (*that the death penalty is an effective deterrence, and is the reason why Singapore is so safe*).

On the last point, I have yet to see a single academic study or dataset that irrefutably supports the thesis that the death penalty acts as a good deterrence for crimes like murder or drug trafficking. In fact, most of the academic studies that I'm aware of indicate that the death penalty has no statistically significant effect to deter these crimes. Even the statistics that MHA puts out barely indicate that the mandatory death penalty for drug trafficking had any real effect especially in the long run. That's why I'm very sure everybody in this thread defending the death penalty on how it ""keeps Singapore safe"" is absolutely talking out of their ass - they are relying on their own conventional wisdom about what deters crime, when an addicted user-dealer or a person in extreme debt would consider these risks very differently.

The worst arguments are the ones that fully admit that there is no evidence to indicate that the death penalty is an effective deterrence, but then add on - do we really want to find out?

When it comes down to it, the only valid argument I can think of for the death penalty is retribution. That when somebody does something bad, the state should have the power to punish them - not just to potentially rehabilitate them (which the death penalty obviously fails to do), or to deter future crime (which the death penalty, I'd argue, also fails to do), but because **they deserve it**. To be honest, I'm not too much of a fan about this argument either - but it's not something that can be easily refuted because it's something of an ethical postulate - that is, if you were to ask somebody why they think they deserve it, they'll probably answer: *they just do*. And if that's the case, I have very little way to say that you're wrong even if I disagree with you.",askSingapore,2,t1_i6ex9cg

As for the second point, it would be prudent not to under-estimate the ability for humans to live under dire circumstances and not betray their soul by taking the easy way out. It wasn't that long ago when our great-grand/ grandparents lived through unbelievably tough times during WW2 and still managed to pull through with blood, sweat and tears and here we are reaping the fruits of their labour.

Suppose you set the death penalty as the punishment for rape like many suggest. What do you think would happen?

Some potential rapists may be deterred but those who do commit the crime may then be incentivised to kill the rape victim to reduce their chance of getting caught.

Argument 2: the death penalty wastes human potential

One of the arguments I've heard is that capital punishment helps to reduce the incidence of crime. My response is: so what? 

Take medical negligence for instance. It has been estimated that close to 100,000 preventable deaths each year in the US can be attributed to medical negligence. If we transpose this statistic to Singapore, it means that around 800 people die from medical negligence each year locally. Should we then try to reduce this by punishing doctors and nurses more harshly, perhaps even through the death penalty? Intuitively, this sounds wrong because a trained doctor or nurse is a scarce human resource in any society and we have a lot of respect for them. A doctor or nurse can be rehabilitated to serve society more productively even if he or she caused a death through negligence.

Lets just ignore for a moment that [https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/policy-issues/deterrence](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/policy-issues/deterrence), there are some studies showing that they dont really have that much difference between crime rate when DP is present or not. 

In essence, using a punishment as deterrence can be ethically wrong in"" Kant's moral principle that man should always be treated as an end in himself, not only as a means for some other end."" To promote the good of society at the harm of the individual. But how much harm should we place on the individual?

Some say death penalty is the most cruel punishment but i disagree. If we truly believe that a stronger punishment = stronger deterrence, why dont we punish them more to deter others? Why not before the execution date, punish him by torture 24/7?",askSingapore,1,t1_i6dqx3j

however, even then, from a cursory google search, there is really no direct link between the death penalty in isolation and a country’s crime rate. many other factors such as the economical status of the countries, geographical situation, and state policies around education and rehabilitation. many others have explored this in this thread. 

but any and every argument against the death penalty is founded in the “irrational”. killing people who are deemed as incondusive to society is pretty much the most efficient solution. given the widespread damage a stable and accessible supply of drugs can do to a country, a case can be made to execute (an arbitrary number here) up to 5000 people suspected of drug involvement a year, regardless of actual guilty, and society as a whole would probably still come out ahead. way more people die of accidents and illness than that, and those people aren’t criminals. 

so why do we even only reserve the death penalty for the worst offenders? because killing is immoral- and that is an emotional sentiment through and through. there are really no “valid” arguments because the premise is one as statistically significant as honor and kindness. 

i believe killing to be wrong. as do most of society, on an individual level. so any argument about when it is acceptable/encouraged to kill another person is going to be based on emotions and morals, and trying to talk about rationality and statistics is simply fallacious and hypocritical.

While this statement is not wrong, it's disingenuous.

So everyone 1 in 4 people will have lower than average IQ. If we were to be more lenient and use the broader definition of ""average"", to include IQ scores between 80-120, then 9% of the population will fall outside that category. So that's 1 in 11 people.

t1,in0dpj2,t3_x5bmpd,2022-09-04 03:07:27,Hazelnut526,"TL;DR. Money and moral issues. In money, marijuana is a profitable industry with some countries reporting nice income and tax revenue from it. From the moral point of view, to let adults decide whatever substance they want to consume. 

There are multiple sides of debate here, I'll try to cover them all. The first side is the consumption/production-distribution. Each country has different opinions on the matter, regarding on which economic sector it would participate:
1) Selling/Consumption: This is where Singapore would participate more, by making legal it's consumption. There are basically 2 types of consumption, one less polemical than the other.

1a) The less polemical consumption is for medicinal uses. Marihuana (it doesn't have to be smoked) has multiple chemical components that work really well dealing with pain, specially chronical pain. Multiple countries have legalized the consumption for medicinal uses and this is easy to regulate. As you'd have basically the same infrastructure/regulation that you apply to TCM, applied to marihuana. 

1b) Recreational consumption is the most polemical. Countries that approved it tend to do it for 2 reasons: 1) it's consumption is already widespread, so you can to legalize it in order to gain revenue from tax, but also to regulate the quality of the substances being sold. Some arguments go that the tax revenue from the selling of recreational marihuana can go to finance health program or even addiction rehabilitation programs (in the case of more hardcore substances). 2) Another reason is too attract tourists and gain income from their money, this is the case of Thailand . Tourism is important in Singapore, but I don't think that they'd need to legalize it to improve it's tourism attractiveness, pero doesn't come to Singapore for being a ""wild and fun country"".

2) Production-distribution. This is another complicated topic, basically because the war on drugs is lost. Drug dealing generates so much money illegally that even after decades of ""war"" the production remains at an all times high, with thousands of deaths. This is more serious for drugs like cocaine, heroin, but marihuana still has its share on it. Countries with strong political power are legalizing it's production, to get a big share of the international market, before allowing other countries to legalize it's production. This is basically the case of the US, with a thriving marihuana industry of millions of dollars.  I really don't see Singapore caring about who production marijuana, as it's not an agricultural country and it's incipient agricultural sector is mostly for food self sustainance. Nevertheless, Singapore would have all the interest in controlling which sources from marihuana is using. Basically: 1) that it was produced and distributed in a legal way, 2) that it complies with whatever sanitary/regulation standard for the people inside it's borders to consume.

Besides the economical reasons, there's is the moral debate of just let adults decide which substances they want to consume and give them freedom of deciding what to do with their own bodies.

Edit: I forgot to add the medium of consumption. Basically you have cigarettes, edibles, ointments. I agree with marihuana legalization, but I strongly oppose smoking in general. Cigarettes have a huge impact in health, but on top of that, second hand smoke affects people who's not participating in the substance consumption.",askSingapore,55,t1_in0dpj2

t1,in1cajo,t3_x5bmpd,2022-09-04 10:01:39,the_wulk,"First, this issue touches a little on addiction, morality vs governance. Should the government be policing our morals as well? A blanket ban on drugs because they are harmful, and might tear families apart, cause a person not able to function due to addiction? Well, then the same can be applied to prostitution, alcohol, cigarettes and gambling, but those are legal, right? So, why the divide? we all draw the line differently, and we need to acknowledge, at least in part, the arbitrariness of it, because I concede that even in my wildest imagination, I cannot imagine sg government legalizing heroine or cocaine.

As for why marijuana, or, more accurately, durgs in particular, the greatest argument *for* it's legalization is:

1. its a form of control. Once a drug is legalized, it will be much, much easier for the government to control it, making sure that the drug is made properly, not toxic (at least, not *more* toxic then it is supposed to be), not cut or mixed with any unknown substance.
2. crime &amp; taxation. legalization of drugs will significantly decrease, if not wipe out the black market for such drugs. Why buy unknown black market shit when you can safe, controlled and QA'ed substances, even if sometimes the cost might be higher? If drugs are legalized, the ease of being able to get your drug of choice will deincentivize you from getting cheaper alternatives from the black market. Tax-wise, it speaks for itself, yes? its another market that the government can tax however heavily it wishes to. Case in point: the vape market. I know many who vape, so missing out on those tax dollars are kind of a waste. The government might be wait-and-seeing, as the research on the harmfulness of vape is still not enough. This is where I need to ask people from the medical field or academia: if singapore had legalized vaping, and done it's own research on it's effects on the human body, will the research be beneficial to singapore? will it boost our reputation, our standing globally or something?

Counter-point:

I recognize that in the 2 points I've mentioned, it takes a significant black market and existing drug problem for these 2 points to make sense. I have no idea how big or small the black market is for drugs in singapore, so personally, I think the government should allow weed in as a controlled substance to do it's own research into it's uses in medical market.

As for recreational use, it ties into the same point that I mentioned first. The arbitrariness of the lines drawn. Should the government control my own body? I don't believe so, especially the law that it is illegal for singaporeans to take drugs overseas.  


Edit: I forgot add this: there are already multiple drugs and activities that you can get addicted to and destroy a person's life, addiction treatment and management is much more important than banning any specific drug.

Most have covered the health benefits, ethical concerns, morality issues etc. so I'll just mention one thing which I think is major, but not really talked about: the popularity of marijuana in media.

It's everywhere, and generally positive. I mean, in music, almost every rap song mentions it. Heck, even the Beibs, possibly one of the biggest pop stars, talks about [getting his weed from California](https://genius.com/Justin-bieber-peaches-lyrics). There have been entire movies made about weed ([Harold and Kumar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_%26_Kumar), [Pineapple Express](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pineapple_Express_(film) &amp; [Ted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCf65MHidEo), to name a few big ones). There are also lots of TV shows where weed is used for comedic effect, or stoners are shown to be happy-go-lucky goofballs. Heck, there are even [memes about it](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/420-blaze-it).

And that's just the stuff I remember, with very overt references to marijuana. There are probably a billion more references to it in various other music, movies, TV shows and on the internet. And all of it portrays it as cool, fun, harmless. 

Contrast that to the government messaging, which tries to portray weed as a scary bogeyman, which will cause you to hallucinate, develop paranoia and fall down a rabbit hole of hard drugs. Not to mention, [these campaigns are usually extremely out-of-touch](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ehwlbe/cannabeast_i_get_the_sentiment_but_dont_quite/).

The origination of your belief that ""drugs r bad"" comes from a bunch of rich, racist, American businessmen and politicians. 

Why do we have to convince you? Convince us is it should be illegal. Tell me why it's dangerous and why you support it being illegal. Note that you didn't even say why you believe what you believe. You unquestioningly believed what you were told about marijuana to the point where you support death for people selling weed....incredible.

\&gt; , I support the death penalty for drug traffickers 

It only needs to be trafficked because governments have made it illegal and created a black market.

\&gt;  I also quite strongly frown upon smokin

Frankly, you've been fooled by a bunch of drug war propaganda.

Unless you support making caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol illegal (keep in mind there is caffeine, a stimulant, in tea, so if your country drinks tea, that has to go too), than you support legalization of a much less dangerous substance: marijuana. 

The whole ""drugs r bad"" thing has no reasoning behind it. You can put what you want in to your body. It's arguably much worse for your health to eat an extra 200 calories of sugar or saturated fat every day than it is to smoke weed, but I assume you don't want to make sugar and saturated fats illegal?

\&gt; And if for recreational use as well, why?

Why not? Because you frown upon it but know nothing about it? People always come from this angle of ""convince me why you should be able to do it!"" Why shouldn't we be able to do it? It's not dangerous. All the science shows a gigantic number of benefits anywhere from reducing anxiety to helping a cancer patient with no appetite eat, to helping with sleep (without needing medication), helping depression (without medication), helping pain management (without highly addicative opiates). Many people use it for creativity, or just basic relaxation. Humans need to relax, that's something everyone needs. There are people who have seizures and tremors and marijuana helps with that. For some people, it helps them laugh. For women, it can increase their libido and help them have an orgasm. For some people, they just like the way it makes them feel. 

Medical evidence shows nothing but benefits, with very mild or moderate downsides like tar in the lungs from smoking (although it not the same as tar from cigarettes and does not appear to correlate with increased risk of lung cancer) and besides, you don't have to smoke it. Most people would take it orally or smoke a refined concentrate like hash oil if it was legal and affordable. The only reason people don't consume it that way much of the time is because it's illegal.

 You cannot overdose on it, unlike essentially everything else including water. It is not physically addictive, only mentally addictive like everything else including food and sex. 

But again, I think the burden of proof is on you: Why SHOULD it be illegal? You are supporting the death penalty for the same kind of thing as someone selling a pack of cigarettes or a 6-pack of beer. 

Tons of people enjoy it recreationally, tons of people use it for a myriad of medical benefits, it is not dangerous, and the only people that want it to be illegal are a bunch of people who know absolutely nothing about weed, they've just been brainwashed with a bunch of drug war propaganda that weed = bad and that you're a bad person if you want to enter an altered mental state (apparently alcohol, nicotine, and caffeine don't count).",askSingapore,3,t1_in43w8k

Drugs is a catch all term for anything that makes your kind feel “altered” however there are a lot of things that do this that we don’t “think of” as drugs. 

Sugar, caffeine… to name a few.. tobacco.. which is HEAVILY used here in Singapore.. 

These all things alter our mind.. 

I don’t support the death penalty for anything, because people deserve second chances.. it’s possible you haven’t needed one and that’s privilege 

But I’m definitely against things like heroin, meth and ADDICTIVE drugs because dealers can get someone addicted and get them hooked and make money off of them. 

Drugs that are not addictive : Things like Acid, Weed, and Mushrooms have had a lot of amazing positives in peoples lives and by classifying them as an illegal drug you take away the possibility of scientists creating a healthy way to consume them or even situations for people to consume them responsibly.. there is MUCH more of a healthy use of Weed and Mushrooms then there will ever be for alcohol and tobacco yet those are okay to use? I find this a bit odd.. but we are okay with it because it’s been normalized to us. 

You probably look at weed and acid as a bad thing because you’ve been told they are, you haven’t experienced them yourself but thousands of people have had these substances change their lives. - me being one.. and I know hundreds of others. 

There is literally not one reason alcohol should be legal while weed is not, weed doesn’t make people aggressive, it doesn’t make them easy targets to rape, it doesn’t even make them hung over.. it really just makes you calm happy and hungry.. that feeling of being “on edge” that you get.. it just drifts away.. 

Or you know when you are trying to enjoy something fully.. but your brain fights you.. and makes you think about other things.. anxiety.. weed takes that away.. so you can just relax for a minute and breath..

Let’s look at the pros and cons.

Pros - does not make you violent (alcohol does). Does not harm any 3rd parties. It’s not chemically addictive (cigarettes are chemically addictive). No long term negative side effects. Had medicinal properties. Paper made from cannabis is more economical.

Cons - may cause schizophrenia. Might not be chemically addictive, but is still addictive. Makes you unproductive. Makes you a pretentious cunt. Smoking weed, like smoking cigarettes, isn’t good for your lungs (obviously there’s other ways of ingesting). The munchies.

Now, does it harm any 3rd party, directly or indirectly? No. Does it cause self-harm? You could argue both ways, but so does smoking cigarettes or working in a high risk job, and video games and Netflix makes you unproductive.

So ultimately, penalising Mary Jane the government dictating what you can or cannot do in your free time. Either you are allowed to be unproductive in your free, or you’re not (and that’ll be tyrannical), so what makes video games and Netflix an ok unproductive hobby, and cannabis not?

Obviously no one is saying people will go to work stoned, because it’s unprofessional. Also, legalise psychedelics while you’re at it.

I can understand people supporting the death penalty for acts of murder and other crimes that maliciously cause the deaths of others.

I don't understand having a death penalty for drug trafficking, let alone a mandatory death penalty for drug trafficking. It is completely arbitrary. You can trot out the 'National education' argument that if drugs were available, many Singaporeans would be in a hurry to get addicted and they would ruin their families etc etc... The question I have for people who actually believe this is:  Assuming, generously, that this is straightforwardly true, why aren't we hanging Karl Liew and Liew Mun Leong and everyone else involved in fucking her over by lying to the court? Mdm Parti Liyani's life and career here has been trashed. It would be surprising if she did not have mental health issues arising from this. Her family's had no income from her for over 4 years. Read her victim impact statement that the prosecution refused to admit in court. This whole nonsense is objectively just as devastating as her deciding to get addicted to any of a number of hard drugs. This is before you consider the damage this scandal has done to the rule of law and social harmony here. And here is the thing, unlike a drug addict, Mdm Liyani made no choice to get framed for this that is in anyway equivalent to the choice that people make to buy and misuse drugs.

More broadly, there are many types of crimes that by second and third order effects 'ruin lives/families/social harmony' and that if left uncontrolled undermine society. I would say that most things we consider crimes can have this effect. Yet we don't hang all of the people who do these crimes. We don't hang the phone scammers, the people who run MLM scams. We don't hang thieves and robbers. We don't hang all those sex criminals. We don't hang drunk drivers.

Authoritarians say that we should hang drug traffickers to save the lives of others. That logic might work in cases where there is great imminence. eg: Shooting a terrorist dead to prevent him from imminently killing others. The real world application becomes deeply inconsistent and problematic once you start dealing with second or third order unintended consequences. You could theoretically save lives if you hang all of the above mentioned criminals. People lose their life savings all the time to scammers which contributes to suicide. People lose their lives to drunk drivers all the time. Even relatively non-violent acts of thievery can kill people if circumstances go wrong.--yet we hang thieves for the people they actually kill rather than hanging all of thieves on the basis of the people they theoretically could have killed. The inconsistency is non-obvious only because we don't have a body of propaganda justifying hanging people in all of these offences.

You can trot up some defensive and insular argument about how other countries are shitholes.--a transparent play to stir up Sinkie nationalism in support of the death penalty for drugs. To the extent that this is even vaguely true, say in the uber-progressive parts of California who unfortunately let the rest of that pleasant state down, I would say that I worry far less about the druggies than I do about the screaming vagrants, the car thieves and the people who practice open defecation. You can argue that drugs have some unique causal relationship and that all these behaviors are downstream of that and I don't think you would be right. The arrow of causality in SF seems to run in the direction of homelessness, then drug abuse rather than the other way around. And the smash and grab thieves are pretty athletic and organised. This is a criminal business. The people involved in it are not likely to be addicts. Singapore has people who do these things, (far) fewer of them for sure, but we don't hang people who do these things and no one here seriously thinks we should.

SF is fabulously, extremely wealthy and yet parts of it are really awful. I think some of the lessons from the place flatter Singapore's approach.--you need competent and effective policing as well as consistent and firm penalties for criminal behavior. OTOH many of the lessons should make any Singaporean less optimistic. For example: It is bad for society to have extreme wealth inequality, excessive living costs and unaffordable housing. Fear mongering about societal failure is easy.--just shout that if we stop hanging drug dealers/legalise gambling/repeal 377a/etc, the end times will come.  Analyzing the real causes of societal failure with any real introspection is hard.

The thing that should bother people about our death penalty for drugs is that the reasons for it don't mesh with any natural justice or proportionality. It does not mesh with any sense that life is sacred and that if it has to be taken should perhaps only be forfeited only in defence of or punishment for another. And we cannot be blase about the limits of human knowledge and wisdom.  Instead, we have have a system that can kill people for fearmongering politicized reasons.

It was too airy fairy to deserve a specific response. A simple ""respect our sovereignty, our laws are our own"" would have sufficed. 

Branson's [23rd April 2023 blog post](https://www.virgin.com/branson-family/richard-branson-blog/why-tangaraju-suppiah-doesnt-deserve-to-die) is different. He talks specifically about a case and how it was handled in our courts. For *this* accusation, he needs to bring specific facts to the table. He cannot speak in vague, airy fairy terms. 

So when he says this: 

&gt; Equally, if not more disconcerting about this case is that Tangaraju was actually not anywhere near these drugs at the time of his arrest. **This was largely a circumstantial case that relied on inferences. Investigators and prosecutors acted on the fact that his mobile numbers were stored on the actual drug traffickers’ phone, interpreting phone records and text messages as “proof” of his involvement.** Tangaraju’s alleged co-conspirator – who was actually caught in possession of the drugs – pleaded guilty to a non-capital offence. The other three people connected to the case were “discharged not amounting to an acquittal” by the prosecution. Tangaraju himself has maintained his innocence from the very beginning of his ordeal.

Well, this better be water-tight. 

Let's see, shall we? The trial judgment is available [here](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Portals/0/Docs/Judgments/2019/[2018]%20SGHC%20279%20\(amended\).pdf). Here's what happened: 

**Mogan** is Tangaraju's ""alleged conspirator"" (as Branson puts it). Mogan had never met Tangaraju, and had only saved him on the phone under the alias, ""India"". He did a job for India, to deliver cannabis from Malaysia to Singapore. Mogan was caught with the drugs and agreed to help the police catch India. The police laid a trap with Mogan as bait at McDonalds in West Coast Park. Mogan told India he was in the toilet (he wasn't - it was a trap). A guy turned up - Suresh - and went into the toilet. When he came out, Suresh was arrested. Mogan called India again, and India told him that India had asked his friend to meet Mogan instead. Mogan asked India to show up but India never did. 

The phone numbers Mogan had saved for India, were xx39 and xx93. 

Meanwhile...

**Suresh** is Tangaraju's friend. Suresh had saved the same numbers for Tangaraju, under the alias ""Appu bro"" and ""Apu2"". Suresh had met with Appu before in person. Suresh spoke to Appu on the phone regularly with both numbers. On the day of the trap, his friend Appu told him to meet someone at McDonalds in West Coast Park. While Suresh was there, Appu kept asking Suresh about whether this ""someone"" was present in the McDonalds in West Coast Park. Finally Appu asked Suresh to check the toilet, and Suresh went into the toilet. When he came out, he was arrested. 

Meanwhile...

**Tangaraju** was arrested not for trafficking drugs, but for failing to show up to do a mandatory urine test following drug consumption. He was charged, released on bail, and then continued to fail to show up for his urine tests. So he was brought in again, and then the police realised he was potentially linked to Mogan and Suresh's arrest. 

In his statements (there were a few), Tangaraju **admitted** that he had the xx93 phone number. That's the number that he gave to the police when he reported for his urine tests. But he denied communicating to Mogan on it. He said he could have lost that mobile phone temporarily, someone else could have texted Mogan. He also denied speaking to Suresh. For the xx39 number, he said Suresh was lying. For the xx93 number, he gave the same excuse that he could have lost his mobile phone temporarily, and someone else communicated with Suresh. 

During the trial, there was a lot of back and forth as to who said what. But in the end, the judge came to the conclusion that Suresh was not ""India"", **and that Tangaraju was ""India""**, and all of Tangaraju's evidence as to why he could not have been ""India"", were not believable. For example, he'd meet with Suresh for food, immediately after having lost his mobile phone... and did not provide Suresh a new number. In the judge's words, this ""defied logic"". The judge also caught Tangaraju out in a lie (he'd said he saw Suresh submit an MC to avoid a urine test, but that MC was still on Suresh's person when he was arrested). 

Branson, Dicky-boy, whoever it is who is summarising these cases for you, you need to fire them.

(edit) Note: there is more to this case than just what I posted above. There are questions of procedure - Tangaraju claimed the prosecution had failed to disclose Mogan and Suresh's statements to him, which I gather was important because it would help explain why Tangaraju came up with the ""lost my phone"" story one month after giving his initial statement. There's the nature of the crime he was charged with. All of that I think is fair to have a discussion about. But based on the judgment, and absent any evidence of actual incompetence like in the Parti case, I think it is quite disingenuous of Branson to paint this kind of misleading picture.",singapore,13,t1_jhn62vp

There is a vocal minority that actively opposes and campaigns against it - especially for some particular cases that crop up from time to time - but most surveys still indicate that it has quite a bit of support from the general public.

I've always wondered why that was... Almost every reddit thread on /r/singapore has the same few tired tropes about how the death penalty is an effective deterrent, how Singapore will descend into a drug-filled hellscape like places in the ""west"" if we were to abolish the death penalty, and emotional pleas about, ""what if it were your family?"". None of these arguments are very strong. There is little to no strong empirical evidence that the death penalty deters (most meta-analysis of the use of the death penalty in academic research finds no statistical difference between places that use the death penalty and places that don't), nor do I think any strong data in Singapore's case that suggests that the introduction of the mandatory death penalty reduced the inflow of specific drugs that each policy targetted (supply side policies to tackle drug consumption has almost universally been met with failure and backfire). 

And yet, I won't be surprised if this thread becomes filled with those same tired arguments again. What I've become convinced of is that most Singaporeans don't really know how to articulate why they support the death penalty. Ultimately, it's an ideological commitment. The death penalty, I think, crystallizes this ideal that certain actions are simply not tolerated in Singapore and that we will do everything that we can to demonstrate our disgust and anger and our quite literally violent need to stamp it out. That anything that creates a disorder that threatens our stability as a community needs to be destroyed and destroyed completely. It makes sense especially considering Singapore's collectivist culture where such deviance is so frowned upon. Add in the additional in-group out-group psychologies that come up with the East-West divide, and it starts to become clear why Singaporeans are so overwhelmingly against progressive crime reform.",singapore,21,t1_jghockr

Even today, many westerners only know Singapore for MBS, flogging; banning chewing gum; death sentence for drugs; anti-gay good at math and being very boring.  These are your allies and trade partners and foreign investors. 

Richard Branson is far more famous than any Singaporean ever, even LKY.   He is instantly recognisable.   He is also a billionaire and can easily raise more money.  Last year he launched a campaign to eliminate the death penalty.  19 other company executives signed on including Ben and Jerry’s and Tiffany.  Since then many more — Salesforce CEO, Tony Fernandes, COO of Facebook, CEO of Bayer, CEO of Unilever, President of the Body Shop, Founder and CEO of 23andMe, Founder of Y Combinator.  Also plenty of top lawyers, a bunch of ethical finance funds …. and dozens of other companies.  https://www.businessagainstdeathpenalty.org/

These people can easily raise funds to hire an army of lawyers, analysts, researchers, etc.  They can analyse the human rights record of Singapore on death penalty and back up with supplements on maid treatment, foreign worker treatment, and should anyone want to play dirty don’t forget how many rich Singaporean families have secrets both now and going back to their roots as … opium traders. 

Should he choose to debate — Richard Branson will fly on a private jet — Singapore doesn’t need to pay (all these signatories have jets already but thanks for the offer).  

And every one of those signatories can put pressure on Singapore.  Every one of them has a massive personal and professional network.  Y Combinator is practically the heart of Silicon Valley.   You want to discuss drug prices with Bayer?  You want to discuss Salesforces regional HQ?  You want to get venture capital or ethical investment firms into Singapore?  Guess what, things just got a lot harder.  That’s without any debate.  

Then, they have a whole bunch of NGOs that will help with media coverage to make sure every mistake, every scandal, every secret comes out in international media.  Singapore will look like Myanmar if they choose.  

Debate or no debate Singapore be lumped in with the backwards US southern states and a bunch of poor countries as the last places on earth to get rid of the death penalty.

Remember who benefits if our drug laws are loosened ? It will be the UK, also another financial centre.

If u have druggies running rampantly, i wont consider Singapore as a safe place.

While the comments could have been better phrased, i've no disagreement with what the government has said given that the West or UK side themselves havent given us much respect either over the years and downplay our efforts in solving the drug issues. We clearly succeeded thats why we are one of the safest countries in the world now. Watch interviews by 'official' media in UK like the BBC on predecessors like Mr Lee kuan yew and Mr Goh Chok Tong.

&gt; SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said it has invited British billionaire Richard Branson to Singapore for a live televised debate with its minister K Shanmugam on the country's approach towards drugs and the death penalty.

&gt; Mr Branson has been vocal in his views against Singapore's death penalty for crimes such as drug trafficking, most recently in a blog post on Oct 10. Earlier this year, he spoke out against the execution of convicted drug trafficker Nagaenthran Dharmalingam.

&gt; In response to his blog post, MHA said in a media release on Saturday (Oct 22) that he made false assertions about alleged racial bias and the treatment of defence lawyers.

&gt; The ministry also reiterated Singapore's stance on drugs, saying that the capital sentence has had a clear deterrent effect on drug traffickers in Singapore.

&gt; ""Our priority is to protect Singapore and Singaporeans from the scourge of drugs,"" said MHA. ""We take a comprehensive harm prevention approach, which includes the use of the death penalty for traffickers who traffic large amounts of drugs and seek to profit from destroying other people’s lives and livelihoods.""

&gt; In inviting Mr Branson to a debate on the issue, MHA said: ""Mr Branson’s flight to and accommodation in Singapore will be paid for.

&gt; ""Mr Branson may use this platform to demonstrate to Singaporeans the error of our ways and why Singapore should do away with laws that have kept our population safe from the global scourge of drug abuse.""

This is my biggest concern in any capital punishment system. And he is right to not want to do a short debate.

It needs to be a comprehensive back and forth over months or years to iron out all the issues because it is so nuanced a topic.

I still think there should be a Death penalty, but with Life without possibility of parole for cases where you cannot prove beyond reasonable doubt. And both shouldn't be applied to bloodless economic crimes, ie drug trafficking.

&gt;In fact, there is no evidence that the death penalty reduces crime anywhere, not even in Singapore.

It definitely doesn't save lives or reduce crime. And I don't think it ought to be a standard mode of punishment. But it certainly does prevent particular irregular individuals from repeating crimes, and for people that need to be permanently removed from society, death is probably way less of a torture than being locked and isolated in a cell for the rest of their natural life.

I have decided to decline this invitation. Here is why: a television debate - limited in time and scope, always at risk of prioritising personalities over issues - cannot do the complexity of the death penalty any service. It reduces nuanced discourse to soundbites, turns serious debate into spectacle. I can’t imagine that is what you are looking for. What Singapore really needs is a constructive, lasting dialogue involving multiple stakeholders, and a true commitment to transparency and evidence.*

\-'nuff said. mad respect. o7

*The other reason is that this conversation needs local voices. I am a global advocate for abolition of the death penalty, and I will continue to raise the issue wherever I can, as I have for many years. But in this advocacy, we stand on the shoulders of giants. In Singapore’s case, we have been inspired by several people and organisations - advocates, lawyers, journalists - with experience, knowledge and data. The brave thing for you would be to actively engage those Singaporean stakeholders, from Transformative Justice Collective to Mr M Ravi, Nagaenthran Dharmalingam’s courageous lawyer, and regional voices, such as the Anti-Death Penalty Asia Network, and treat them as equals who are just as interested in Singapore’s progress as I’m sure you are.*

&gt; SINGAPORE: British billionaire Richard Branson declined the Ministry of Home Affairs’ (MHA) invitation to a debate on Singapore’s approach towards drugs and the death penalty, saying the conversation “needs local voices” and that a television debate “cannot do the complexity of the death penalty any service”.

&gt; In an open letter posted on his blog on Monday (Oct 31), Mr Branson said that such a debate “reduces nuanced discourse to soundbites, turns serious debate into spectacle” and urged the ministry to engage stakeholders such as advocates, lawyers and journalists.

&gt; “Abolition is not, as some argue, a Western concept imposed on the rest of the world,” he added. “This is about universal human rights and humanity’s shared aspiration to advance equality, justice, dignity, and freedom everywhere, for everyone.”

&gt; He also expressed “enormous respect for Singapore and Singaporeans and for everything your country has achieved over the last decades” in his letter, which was addressed to Singapore’s Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam.

&gt; “It is because of this respect that I feel compelled to speak out when I see things go as horribly wrong as Singapore’s use of the death penalty,” he said.

&gt; “And I am not a lone voice raising this. There are many Singaporeans, including lawyers, human rights defenders, civil society organisations, and others, who have consistently expressed the same concerns.”

&gt; Mr Branson also said that imposing the death penalty for drug offences is a “disproportionate and ineffective” response to the problem.

at the end of the day Shan is an idealogue and doesn't wanna look at evidence that demonstrates that the death penalty isn't worth having as state policy, from any angle. unfortunately, majority of the population agrees with Shan, since not everyone is clued into criminology and penalogy. 

as with many issues, the PAP is just scared to rock the boat. to them, a bit of extra cost, inefficiency, and a few human lives is not worth the risk of turning Singapore into a druggie paradise - despite the tonne of evidence demonstrating how flawed and ludicrous this thinking is. 

they know what the evidence is. they just don't see the personal benefit in changing the policy. a few dead poor people never stopped them from sleeping well at night.

one more thing I want to note: the gov wants to keep the majority on this side of the issue. alignment is always good for the gov esp when its stance here will never change (cf gambling). so these sort of public displays and propaganda are always necessary, and frankly a small price to pay. if death penalty goes the way of 377A it can get awkward for the gov and is just troublesome.",singapore,68,t1_iugrk4i

Well, I believe regular polls are done. Not sure what are the research methods but as much as there are abolitionists, there are as many people who believe in Death Penalty as a punitive measure to uphold law and order. As long as Singapore is still a representative democracy, the people still hold some influence over its social fabric, like how the recent constitution was amended to protect the definition of marriage against court challenges.

&gt; ATTITUDES TOWARDS THE DEATH PENALTY IN SINGAPORE

&gt; An earlier study in 2020 - commissioned by MHA and done by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) - found that 79 per cent of respondents who were Singapore citizens and permanent residents believed that the death penalty deters people from trafficking substantial amounts of drugs into Singapore.

&gt; The survey, involving 2,000 residents, found that 70 per cent of respondents believed that the death penalty is more effective than life imprisonment in deterring people from trafficking drugs.

&gt; In a separate 2021 study, conducted by MHA's Research and Statistics Division (RSD), a majority of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the mandatory death penalty was the appropriate punishment for trafficking a significant amount of drugs (65.6 per cent), from using firearms (71.1 per cent) and intentional murder (80.5 per cent).

&gt; This group of respondents was further asked whether the discretionary death penalty or life imprisonment would be a more appropriate punishment for serious crimes.

&gt; A large majority of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that some form of the death penalty - mandatory or discretionary - was an appropriate punishment for committing intentional murder (88.2 per cent), for the use of firearms (82 per cent) and for trafficking a significant amount of drugs (73.4 per cent).

&gt; The mandatory death penalty means that the sentencing court must impose the death penalty on the offender once he is found guilty of that crime, and has no power to impose any other type of sentence.

&gt; DEATH PENALTY FOR SERIOUS CRIMES

&gt; Both studies also showed that there was strong support in Singapore among residents for the country's use of the death penalty as punishment for the most serious crimes.

&gt; For instance, the IPS survey showed that a large majority of respondents (74 per cent) agreed or strongly agreed that the death penalty is ""justified"" for the most serious of crimes, such as intentional murder, use of firearms, and trafficking a significant amount of drugs.

&gt; Similarly in the RSD survey, 73.7 per cent of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the death penalty should be used for the most serious crimes.

&gt; The RSD survey which involved 2,000 residents, comprising both citizens and permanent residents, also showed that a large majority of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the death penalty in Singapore deters the trafficking of significant amounts of drugs (83.2 per cent), firearm offences (85.9 per cent), and intentional murder (85.9 per cent).

&gt; The respondents were also asked about their confidence in Singapore's criminal justice system.

&gt; A majority of respondents (88.5 per cent) said they had confidence in the police and the Central Narcotics Bureau in ensuring that accused persons in death penalty cases were subjected to fair and rigorous investigations.

&gt; The survey also found that 88.1 per cent of respondents had confidence in the Attorney General’s Chambers and the courts in giving the same group of accused persons fair and rigorous trials.

&gt; Less than 2 per cent of respondents indicated that they did not have confidence that Singapore’s criminal justice system would be able to do so.

&gt; The three studies were commissioned to better understand the views of local residents and the perceptions of residents in regional cities on the use of the death penalty in Singapore, said MHA.

&gt; All three studies showed that there is very strong support among Singapore residents for the country's use of the death penalty for the most serious crimes, such as intentional murder, use of firearms and trafficking substantial amounts of drugs, added the ministry.

&gt; ""There is also a clear consensus, both domestically and within the region, that the death penalty is effective in deterring people from trafficking drugs into Singapore and is more effective than life imprisonment in doing so.""

&gt; The studies can be found on MHA's website.

t1,itkvtpf,t3_y7pz8i,2022-10-24 12:15:29,direstorm87,"I don’t understand why the anti death penalty activist always like to use human rights and it’s just the mules we are executing as an argument. 
Human rights of the family members as their criminal family members are punished is irrelevant as I see it. If you see the interview of those family members, they knew their family member is doing drugs. Some since young even. What did they do? They watched them fall into the abyss. Did they contact anyone for help before they fall deeper and start trafficking? They sort of tried to ignore the problem cos maybe bao toh the family member will go jail? Then when it becomes a death sentence then it becomes society problem, mental issues, blah blah blah. But did they do any early intervention? And if the activists want to look at it this way, shouldn’t they address the societal issues and start more anti drug workshops or whatever, create awareness how and where ppl can seek help. Maybe even shed light on how early intervention by family could result in positives. If the rehabbed druggies have issues, shouldn’t they look at creating opportunities or the follow ups that they can do to help. Create an environment where we can have the law but we do not have to invoke it. That way we help our own fellow singaporeans. As for foreigners, they really are out of our jurisdiction and they have their own sovereignty to uphold. If they want, why don’t they go Malaysia or whichever country and spread the news of our “barbaric laws” then they would stop and think twice or thrice before coming over with drugs. The activists are really just giving a superficial solution to the drug issues by telling us to do away with death penalty. It doesn’t resolve anything at the end. All the mental and societal issues are still there. If they say these issues are too big for them, then start somewhere small like in our schools. I don’t want it to be a case where we stopped a well working system because these people are so vocal they think they can represent all of us. Or even because they have all those foreign interest groups at their back. Then we stop the law, then ppl can brazenly bring in drugs. As a regional port of call for most ships, we could very well become a very big distribution centre for drugs. Then we can look westward to where our futures lie. Druggies on the streets, drug trading outside schools. Isn’t democracy a system of the majority? Asking to stop a law working well is like Chinese say, 治标不治本. Treating the symptoms but not the root cause. I watched an YouTube channel Soft white underbelly, the YouTuber interviewed drug addicts or abusers. Drugs may not be the root cause, but to resolve it you have to tackle the societal issues driving the drug abuse. He was brutally honest and said the current generation has no hope in USA and they should focus on the next generation already. We have good anti drug laws and systems in place, we are not losing the drug war, why are we or why would we want to give in? At least we could still have hope for the current gen of abusers. Furthermore, shouldn’t the benefit of the majority be considered since we are in a democratic country? I for sure will vote for death penalty. Kill one person who brought in drugs that potentially harm a few hundred people. One family in distress over a few hundred families in distress over drugs. I hate also to see those people who say drug taking is a choice. You expect school students who are naive and young to not fall prey to street smart adults luring them? You must be fucking insane! Sex predators groom underage victims, drug pushers groom underage addicts. Getting rid of drug traffickers reduce drugs on the streets for pushers to sell to children. Simple demand supply law.

t1,isx8ura,t3_y7pz8i,2022-10-19 11:23:57,LUBE__UP,"The deterrence factor has never been a legitimate argument against the death penalty so I'm not sure why it keeps getting brought up in relation to drugs. Obviously something that imposes an additional potential cost, especially one as large as death, will reduce the incidence of an activity at the margin - it might even reduce it substantially, but so what? We could chop off the hands of thieves and embezzlers and that would also deter thieves and embezzlers far more than any fine or jail term, but doesn't that imply amputation is the right penalty to adopt?

As I understand it, the main arguments against the death penalty, for any crime, revolve primarily around:

1. The relationship between the state and its people, or *should the state have the right to end a life when peaceful alternatives exist.* In most societies we recognize that states need a monopoly on legitimate violence to function, and therefore allow the police and the armed forces to be armed to defend against threats to our lives or way of life; yet would we be okay if the pistol was the first and only instrument a policeman reaches for instead of his voice, his baton and his taser? If we believe that everyone has a right to life that extends beyond even the state's capacity to take it outside of the most exigent of circumstances, then should someone convicted of a capital crime and is already in custody not be jailed instead of killed?
2. The cost of false convictions. It may well be true that 100% of every person ever sentenced to death is exactly guilty of the charge that he / she was convicted of, but what if just 1 person was not? Would all the perceived benefits of the death penalty be worth that singular life, or would it be a fair trade, a 'cost of doing business'? What if that life happened to be yours, or someone you knew? 

&amp;#x200B;

And finally, particularly with drug offenses, the primary argument is

1. Does the crime warrant the punishment? On some level we have an innate sense of what is 'just'. Chopping an arm off for pinching pinching ten dollars is too barbaric to even consider. But when politicians point to the tens, if not hundreds of thousands of drug related crime and thousands of deaths attributed to drug addiction, then the calculus seems to swing overwhelmingly the other way. We think 'boy, if someone shot one of my parents it would be just if he died too', and therefore 'he has or planned to kill thousands, he definitely should die'. But has he, in the same way as a serial killer or mass murderer specifically sets out to kill?  If our calculus for 'just' punishment can be stretched so that someone who provides a willing buyer with a substance that has negative side effects should be sentenced to death, then where do we draw the line? Sheer lives lost (which would surely ensnare the purveyors of soft drinks and fast food in its net, diabetes and cardiovascular related ailments having killed millions upon millions),  some complicated weighing between positive and negative effects (would you be willing to give up alcohol, on the basis of the 'high' being much less intense, or beneficial, than cocaine, yet in many measures being more addictive, leading to more complications and causing more societal harm than cocaine?

I don't for one moment believe that the respondents are irrational, but most people in Asia have not and do not spend a lot of time thinking about ethics, justice, or other 'mushy' questions like 'what does it mean for something to be *right'.* I believe the survey, either out of ignorance or malice, exploits this hole.",singapore,-9,t1_isx8ura

My hot take? Not that hot, but I think the studies aren’t telling us anything new or useful.

1. **Most Singaporeans support imposing a death penalty on drug traffickers**: This shows the government has the mandate to retain the law. This was a worthwhile question asking, but my suspicion is this just confirms what everyone already knew.

2. **Most Singaporeans think the death penalty is an effective deterrent against drug trafficking**: I don’t doubt this is a fair reflection of public opinion. But so what? To deter something, surely the government should do what works, rather than what laymen  _think_ works. Heck, I think even the survey respondents might have agreed with this.

3. **Southeast Asians think Singapore’s death penalty deters drug trafficking**: The most charitable interpretation here is: foreigners think our laws deter, and they’re the people we’re trying to deter, so clearly our laws are successfully deterring. This is questionable — it’s likely their survey underrepresents people from the troubled backgrounds that drug traffickers come from. There’s no point listening to the ramblings of some rando who is neither a constituent nor an expert nor a potential drug trafficker. 

Call me naive, but I do think MHA might have been open to changing their mind if the survey had showed overwhelming opposition to the death penalty in Singapore.

I don't think anyone disputes this statement; most people are interested in:
1) How harsh the punishment should be
2) What kind of drugs should qualify under drug trafficking

- Saying that the death penalty is an effective deterrent  because ""it has worked so far"" is an appeal to tradition, we do not have compelling evidence that the death penalty has a casual effect on the low drug trafficking rates in Singapore. 
In fact, it seems that from the data provided by CNB, the drug trafficking rates have gone up in the recent years, with the estimated drug seized annually going from 6.49 to 11.60 million dollars from 2019 to 2020.
This makes me question the rationale and basis for keeping the death penalty. 

- Not all drugs are the same. In fact, a lot of drugs traditionally prescribed to normal people like you and me, can ""make you high"" at a high enough dosage. 
Yet, they are prescribed to you because at the right dosage, it serves the right purpose. 
In the case of drugs like cannabis, at the right dosage, it can be used for medicinal or recreational purposes (before you start protesting at the suggestion of recreational use, recreational cannabis is generally less destructive than gambling, cigarettes and alcohol to the individual and its family).

&gt; SINGAPORE: Home Affairs and Law Minister K Shanmugam said on Friday (Sep 2) that Singapore’s policy of having the death penalty for drug trafficking is one that is in the interest of Singaporeans.

&gt; Mr Shanmugam was responding to a question about how Singapore balances conflicting viewpoints, domestically and internationally, on the issue at a dialogue session with students from the Nanyang Technological University.

&gt; “My starting point (is) what is my task as a minister? Do we say we have tough punishment because we want to be tough? Is it because there’s some glory in being tough? None of that,” the minister said.

&gt; “From something as mundane as building a road to naming a building to having policies – whether it’s on aviation, healthcare, Budget, to what kind of penalties we have for littering, molesting, rape, murder, drugs. Everything has got to be based on a certain view on what is in the interest of Singaporeans.”

&gt; Mr Shanmugam cited a survey done by his ministry among non-Singaporeans from parts of the region, where 83 per cent of the respondents said the death penalty made people not want to traffic substantial amounts of drugs into Singapore.

&gt; “If I removed the death penalty, the flow of drugs into Singapore will be much higher. Your lives, your siblings’ lives, many other lives would be at risk. More people will die in Singapore if we removed the death penalty,” he added.

&gt; He also mentioned a separate survey by the ministry, which showed nearly 87 per cent of Singaporeans supporting the death penalty.

&gt; “So there isn’t a great deal of argument within Singapore. It’s some people who keep repeating the points,” the minister said, before adding that Singapore is not alone in capital punishment laws. The death penalty is also in place in the world’s three largest countries – China, India and the United States.

&gt; “All three (countries) have the death penalty so what international practice are you talking to me about?”

&gt; Continuing, the minister cited the high-profile case involving convicted Malaysian drug trafficker Nagaenthran Dharmalingam, who was executed in April after 12 years on death row. The case in Singapore had gained international prominence, with headlines focusing on Nagaenthran’s alleged intellectual disability.

&gt; SINGAPORE - A 31-year-old man who was found with 25 packets of heroin in his bedroom in November 2018 was given the mandatory death penalty on Thursday for drug trafficking.

&gt; Shen Hanjie, a Singaporean, was charged with trafficking more than 2.65kg of a granular and powdery substance that was found to contain 34.94g of pure heroin after analysis. The law provides for the death penalty if the amount of heroin trafficked exceeds 15g.

&gt; During his trial in 2021, Shen claimed at first that he thought the drugs were cannabis and that he was merely safekeeping them for an acquaintance named “Alan” whom he had met only once in person.

&gt; In May, High Court judge Dedar Singh Gill convicted Shen, rejecting his claim that he believed that the packets contained cannabis.

&gt; In his statements to investigators after his arrest, Shen contended that he never opened the packets, never looked at the drugs, never asked Alan what was inside, and knew nothing about the specific nature of their contents.

&gt; But this position evolved during his trial, when Shen claimed he had looked at the drugs and asked Alan what they were, to which Alan replied they were “ganja” – a common name for cannabis.

&gt; “This marked shift in the accused’s evidence and the absence of any credible explanation for this change show the accused’s lack of credit and renders his belated assertion at trial unbelievable,” said Justice Gill.

&gt; The judge similarly rejected the safekeeping defence, which he said was “inherently unbelievable”.

&gt; Shen had consistently admitted in his statements that Alan sent drugs to him so that he could deliver them to others. Two notebooks found in Shen’s room also contained names of 18 people to whom he had previously passed drugs.

&gt; Justice Gill noted that on Shen’s own testimony, Alan had called him out of the blue six months after their first and only meeting to ask if he could keep his things at the accused’s place.

&gt; “What is baffling is that even after the accused found out that Alan had been sending him illicit drugs for storage, the accused continued to ‘help’ Alan, someone whom he barely knew, keep drugs... without any protest and for no payment notwithstanding that he was facing substantial financial difficulties,” said the judge.

&gt; Justice Gill noted that Shen, who was unemployed at the time of his arrest, had to fund his daily consumption of Ice as well as his gambling habit.

&gt; Shen stopped helping out at his father’s coffee shop two years ago and had no other source of income apart from the allowance his parents gave him when he needed money. His financial woes even led him to pawn his and his parents’ items.

&gt; SINGAPORE: The police have issued an advisory to a student from the National University of Singapore (NUS) who held up an anti-death penalty sign during his graduation ceremony in July.

&gt; “In response to media queries, the police, in consultation with the Attorney-General’s Chambers, have issued a written advisory to a 24-year-old man for holding an anti-death penalty sign at the NUS commencement ceremony on Jul 6 at the NUS Cultural Centre Auditorium,” said the police on Friday (Sep 9).

&gt; The man, Luke Levy, on Tuesday tweeted photos of what appeared to be the police advisory.

&gt; They showed the police noting that their investigations into the case have been completed and that they have decided to take no further action against Mr Levy.

&gt; ""You are hereby advised to refrain from such conduct in future,"" the advisory in the photo read.

&gt; Describing this as a ""metaphorical finger-wag"" in his Twitter post, Mr Levy admitted that he had been anxious while ""waiting for months"" to find out what action the police would take.

&gt; “But I knew that this got people talking about the death penalty,” he said. ""That eased my anxiety. No regrets with what I did.”

&gt; Mr Levy added that he would ""keep fighting"" against the death penalty.

Even if all drugs are legalised and regulated, the country cannot compete with the scale and supply of our neighbours.

&gt; SINGAPORE - A 49-year-old man has been sentenced to death for heroin trafficking after the High Court rejected his contention that the majority of the drugs found in his apartment belonged to his 26-year-old girlfriend.

&gt; Mohamed Ansari Mohamed Abdul Aziz, a Singaporean, and his 26-year-old Indonesian girlfriend, Bella Fadila, were arrested by Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) officers on March 24, 2016.

&gt; A search of the couple's rental apartment at Vibes @ East Coast found 77 packets containing more than 760g of a granular substance.

&gt; The substance was found to contain 30.23g of pure heroin after analysis. The law provides for the death penalty if the amount of heroin trafficked exceeds15g.

&gt; Ansari initially claimed that Bella was not involved, but later incriminated her for helping to pack the drugs.

&gt; During his trial, Ansari alleged that 16.51g of the heroin belonged to Bella and that only 13.72g, below the threshold for capital punishment, was his.

&gt; Justice Valerie Thean, who convicted Ansari on July 22, said in written grounds issued on Monday that the prosecution had proven beyond reasonable that Ansari was in possession of all the drugs.

&gt; ""The accused's statements clearly indicated that he was in possession of all of the drugs. His contradictory narrative in the courtroom was not credible. I accepted Bella's evidence that her only role was to assist with packing the drugs,"" said the judge.

&gt; Justice Thean imposed the death penalty on Sept 19, after finding that Ansari was not a courier, which would qualify him for life imprisonment, but had admitted to selling five small packets of heroin for $350 to $400.

&gt; Bella is serving a 26-year jail term after she pleaded guilty in 2018 to a charge of possessing the drugs with the common intention of trafficking the drugs with Ansari.

&gt; She was called as a prosecution witness and testified that all the drugs belonged to Ansari and that she had helped to pack them at his request.

&gt; After his arrest, Ansari initially told CNB officers that his girlfriend was not involved.

&gt; He subsequently told officers in two statements, recorded on March 31 and April 4 that year, that she had helped him pack the drugs.

&gt; In the March 31 statement, he said: ""For the heroin at home, I had asked her to help me pack the heroin into the small Ziplock bags. I think she had only packed less than 15 packets of heroin. The rest, I did it on my own.""

&gt; SINGAPORE: The National University of Singapore (NUS) Commencement Ceremony is ""not a forum for advocacy"", said the university on Thursday (Jul 14), after a student held up an anti-death penalty sign during his graduation ceremony last week.

&gt; NUS student Luke Levy alleged on Twitter on Monday that the university had ""tried their hardest to erase"" what he did on stage, and had edited out his time on stage in a recording of the ceremony.

&gt; Responding to CNA queries, the university said: “The NUS commencement is an important ceremony celebrating the achievements of our 13,975 graduates and the completion of their NUS journey.

&gt; “All graduates and guests are expected to conduct themselves appropriately during the occasion. It is not a forum for advocacy.”

&gt; In the Twitter post, Mr Levy alleged that NUS took down a live recording of the commencement ceremony, and later reuploaded an edited version with “the most obvious jump cut in the world”.

&gt; He also said that in the official stage photograph that he paid for, the photo studio had tried to edit out the words on his sign.

&gt; “When I went up on stage, I unfolded this sign from my gown pocket. It read ‘Abolish the death penalty. No to state murder. End poverty, not life. Blood on your hands’,” read one tweet.

&gt; “I held that sign as I walked on stage, took my on-stage photo, and left the stage, sign in hand,” said Mr Levy in the tweet.

&gt; NUS did not confirm whether it edited Mr Levy out of the clip uploaded on its YouTube channel. According to checks by CNA, the video of the commencement ceremony linked in Mr Levy's tweets has since been made private.

&gt; The police said that a report against Mr Levy has been lodged and they are “looking into” the matter.

&gt; The NUS spokesperson confirmed that the university did not make a police report against Mr Levy.

&gt; A Singaporean man faces the death penalty in Malaysia after being caught with more than 10kg of drugs on Aug. 9, 2022.

&gt; Loh Kok Kiong, 49, was arrested along with his Malaysian girlfriend, Soh Yong Xin, 32. The couple was charged in court in Johor, Malaysia, on Thursday, Aug. 18 with drug trafficking. Both face the death penalty or life imprisonment if convicted.

&gt; Loh faces six charges in total, while Soh faces two, according to The Straits Times (ST).

&gt; Couple accused of trafficking 9.6kg of methamphetamine

&gt; According to Bernama, the couple was caught with the drugs at around 11.15am on Aug. 9 in a Forest City apartment.

&gt; They were allegedly trafficking 9.625kg of methamphetamine (meth) when they were arrested.

&gt; They were also found in possession of 666g of ketamine at the time.

&gt; For these, the couple each face one count of trafficking in dangerous drugs and one count of importing or exporting certain dangerous drugs, according to Bernama.

&gt; Loh accused of injecting drugs at police headquarters

&gt; Separately, Loh faces four additional charges.

&gt; Two of the charges were brought after Loh was alleged to have trafficked 1.505kg of meth and 139g of nimetazepam in a house at Jalan Sutra Kuning, Taman Sutera, according to Bernama.

&gt; Loh is also being charged for drug consumption.

&gt; He allegedly injected meth into his body while at the Iskandar Puteri District Police Headquarters Narcotics Division on the day of his arrest, Bernama reported.

&gt; The fourth charge was brought against Loh after police also found 100g of ketamine in his car on Aug. 9.

&gt; In total, Loh and Soh were caught with as much as 11kg of methamphetamine, 766g of ketamine, and 139g of nimetazepam.

&gt; Bail denied by court

&gt; Bernama reported that the couple was not represented by lawyers in court on Aug. 9.

&gt; They pleaded not guilty to the possession of ketamine, and Loh pleaded not guilty to the consumption of methamphetamine, Bernama wrote.

&gt; No plea was recorded for the other charges in the Aug. 9 hearing, according to ST.

&gt; Under Malaysian law, the offence of drug trafficking carries the death penalty or life imprisonment with whipping of no less than 15 strokes, if convicted.

&gt; Those convicted of importing or exporting drugs may be punished with a fine not exceeding RM100,000 (S$31,000), a jail term not exceeding five years, or both.

&gt; Bail was denied by the Malaysian court. The next court mention is scheduled for Sept. 20, 2022 before the Malaysian High Court, according to ST.

Throughout his post he notes that Branson is “English” or an “Englishman”. Why is this relevant? I assume it’s to set up an argument that RB’s position is some sort of neocolonialism. Hence, the reference to the opium wars (which I also don’t understand? Is Brandon’s criticism equivalent to the Opium wars? Really?!?)

Ok fine. What if it wasn’t an “Englishman” but someone from a former British colony? What if it was a Canadian, a Kiwi or an Aussie? 

Ah, well then those people would be hit with “keep your western values to yourself!”  

So, you can’t have anyone debate the issue from an ang moh country. 

So that leaves two options:

First, you have locals like M Ravi. But frankly he is not the best person. Why? Well unfortunately in this debate no one appears capable of “playing the ball rather than the man.” So, M Ravi’s antics in his professional life unrelated to his anti-DP arguments will be used against him. Same with Kirsten Han. 

Second, so if you can’t find anyone locally and can’t use an anh moh, then you have to find an Asian. In our own backyard I think there are only two countries that have abolished the death penalty: Cambodia and the Philippines. 

The Philippines is probably a better option as I think Duterte did try bring back the DP but it got stalled in their Congress. 

So presumably there are voices in Philippine society who are against the DP and maybe they could be convinced to participate in an “Asian” debate on the issue. Maybe. I know FA about PH politics. 

Again. It still won’t satisfy people. “Look at the Philippines! What a mess! How can we take advice from them!” Sigh sia… again PLAY THE BALL NOT THE MAN! 

And, for the love of god, can the debate be focussed on a single issue like the DP for trafficking offences, namely marijuana given that’s really what all the hoo-ha is about.  It’s tiring to see this constant conflation of issues whether intentional or not.

&gt; SINGAPORE - Hundreds turned up at The Speakers' Corner at Hong Lim Park on Sunday (April 3), with the venue recently reopened after a two-year closure due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

&gt; They were attending a protest against the death penalty in Singapore.

&gt; The participants at the two-hour event held placards with signs such as ""Execution is not the solution"" and ""Help not hang"", as they called for the Government to abolish the death penalty. The event was also live streamed online.

&gt; The Speakers' Corner, which is the only place in Singapore where protests can legally be held, was closed for almost two years from April 2020 when the country imposed a circuit breaker period to curb the spread of Covid-19.

&gt; Crowd sizes for events at the space are limited to 950 people at a time, according to the National Parks Board's (NParks) website. Applications for events there opened on March 23, after Singapore announced the gradual easing of restrictions towards a new phase of living with Covid-19.

&gt; NParks, which manages The Speakers' Corner, said on March 25 that it received six applications for events and its website showed that the space has been booked for several events this month and in June.

&gt; Activist Jolovan Wham, who organised the event on Sunday, was among the 12 speakers at the protest. During his speech, he said recent cases in Singapore involving the death penalty have helped to gather both local and international momentum around the cause to do away with the penalty in Singapore.

&gt; A 68-year-old Singaporean man, Abdul Kahar Othman, was executed last week. He had been sentenced to death for drug trafficking in 2015.

&gt; Malaysian drug trafficker Nagaenthran Dharmalingam, who was convicted of trafficking heroin in 2010, saw his appeal against the death penalty dismissed by the Court of Appeal of Singapore last week.

&gt; Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam said in Parliament last month during the Budget debate that the death penalty continues to remain relevant in Singapore.

&gt; He said that the majority of Singapore residents still support the use of the death penalty and agree that the death penalty deters serious crime, citing preliminary findings from a survey conducted by the Ministry of Home Affairs last year.

&gt; Ms Nadhirah Shapudin, 23, a final-year sociology undergraduate, said that Sunday's protest at Hong Lim Park was the first that she has attended.

&gt; ""I don't want to be pessimistic but I don't think anyone would change because of (today's event), but at least with this, maybe more attention can be brought to the issue and things can happen.""

There are a lot of good discussion points. I'm throwing in my 2 cents.

Personally, I am 100% against death penalty. The system is not perfect and innocent lives can be lost. Furthermore, death is the ultimate punishment. As u/TempleOfPork quoted, ""For even the very wise cannot see all ends."" What if the convicted is the one person who will save us all? And yet, as a society we condemn them to death, and in the process, marking our own doom.

Pragmatically, death penalty is the ultimate deterrence and punishment. Some crimes are so egregious,  cruel and inhumane that the vast majority of well-meaning and gentle-hearted people called for this sentence to be meted out against the offenders. Serial killers who tortured their victims being a clear example. Nothing short of death seems to fit their crimes.

There are also many comments about death penalty for drug trafficking. As mentioned, I am personally against it. But playing devil's advocate, a lot of commenters severely underestimate the addictions to hard drugs. These addictions are akin to slavery. The addicts practically become the slaves of the traffickers. Every moment of their lives are only for the next hit. Such ""evilness"" of the drug traffickers are not that different from slavers.

For those who support death penalty, but are against meting it out for drugs trafficker. Will you still feel the same way if they are slavers? Because they are not that different. Trading people's lives for money. Their cruelty to their fellow people are no less.",singapore,12,t1_i3ba1xh

They also don't believe in the deterrent effect of hanging, at least for drug trafficking. Instead, they seem to me to have less regard for the crime victims.

&gt; SINGAPORE - There is strong support for the death penalty in Singapore and international criticism of it is overstated, Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam has said in an interview.

&gt; In fact, a survey conducted in the region indicates that capital punishment has been a strong deterrent for would-be traffickers, showing that the country's tough stance against narcotics saves lives, he added.

&gt; Mr Shanmugam was speaking about the country's drug laws and Section 377A of the Penal Code, among other things, in an interview with The Sydney Morning Herald. The Ministry of Home Affairs released the transcript of the interview on Monday.

&gt; The recent executions of several drug traffickers in Singapore have drawn criticisms from death penalty activists as well as the UN special rapporteurs and the European Union.

&gt; Asked about this, Mr Shanmugam said: ""Four or five newspaper articles quoting the same three or four activists does not amount to international pressure.""

&gt; He added: ""Internationally, there are some statements issued by UN special rapporteurs, and you have some articles, nothing beyond that. The European Union has an ideological focus on the death penalty, but I would like to ask them if they have a better solution.""

&gt; He noted that the Netherlands has been described as a narco state by the chief of the largest police union in the country, and in Sweden, drug-related gang violence has become a major election issue.

&gt; ""Nobody talks about this. What about the victims of the crime? So, when the European Union is able to tell us there is a better solution, we will listen,"" he added.

&gt; ""We are very tough on traffickers, simply because we consider it as cynical crime, and we want the message out very clearly, that we don't want to become like Western Europe. We don't want to become like most of the Western cities. We certainly don't want to become like many cities in South-east Asia.""

&gt; A case that had brought attention to the death penalty had been that of Malaysian drug trafficker Nagaenthran K. Dharmalingam. Some had criticised Singapore for hanging him on April 27 for smuggling 42.72g of heroin into the country, arguing that his IQ of 69 makes him intellectually disabled.

&gt; Mr Shanmugam said while Nagaenthran's IQ was lower than the average person's, psychiatrists who saw him did not assess him to be intellectually disabled.

&gt; He added that the law looks at whether an offender knew what he was doing, and the courts found that Nagaenthran had known and was creating excuses and finding new ways of trying to explain away his conduct.

&gt; Mr Shanmugam also suggested that Singapore was being held to a higher standard, noting that the US had not been asked similar questions about the execution of two men with IQs in the range of 70 and 90 in October 2021.

&gt; ""Has anyone raised an eyebrow when the US executed at the same time last year in October, two others with the same IQ, and the US courts dismissed the same arguments because the fact that you have a low IQ by itself is not the main point in law,"" he said.

&gt; He added that multiple domestic surveys have also shown that more than 80 per cent of Singaporeans agree with the hanging of drug traffickers.

&gt; SINGAPORE - Two men who were initially convicted of drug trafficking - one of whom was sentenced to the death - were acquitted by the Court of Appeal on Friday (May 27).

&gt; The three-judge court, led by Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon, allowed the appeal of Raj Kumar Aiyachami, 40, against his conviction and mandatory death sentence for drug trafficking.

&gt; The court also allowed the appeal of Ramadass Punnusamy, 41, against his sentence of life imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane.

&gt; The appeals of both men turned solely on whether each of them knew about the nature of the drugs.

&gt; The pair had been charged over a bag of drugs containing not less than 1.875 kg of cannabis.

&gt; Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) officers had observed Ramadass delivering the bag to Raj Kumar on Sept 21, 2015.

&gt; Raj, a Singaporean, who was represented by Mr Ramesh Tiwary, did not dispute that the drugs were in his possession but contended that there had been a mistaken delivery.

&gt; He said he had ordered a tobacco laced with a synthetic chemical that mimicked the narcotic effects of cannabis, known as Butterfly, and had gone to pick it up but received a bag of cannabis instead.

&gt; Ramadass, a Malaysian, did not dispute that he had delivered the bag to Raj, but contended that he did not know the nature of the drugs.

&gt; He said that he had been told that four bags of chemically-sprayed tobacco had been placed in the lorry he was driving.

&gt; Ramadass, who was represented by Mr Eugene Thuraisingam, contested three statements he gave which appeared to suggest he had knowledge of the nature of the drugs.

&gt; The pair were convicted by the High Court in June 2020.

&gt; The trial judge did not believe Raj's account of how he had ordered Butterfly on credit, finding it too incredible.

&gt; The trial judge also rejected Ramadass's evidenceand said he had ample opportunity to tailor his evidence in order to fit Raj's defence.

&gt; Raj was given the mandatory death sentence.

&gt; Ramadass, whom the trial judge found was a courier, was issued a certificate of substantive assistance, and was sentenced to life imprisonment and the mandatory minimum of 15 strokes of the cane.

&gt; On Friday, the Court of Appeal allowed their appeals and overturned their conviction.

&gt; The court said Raj had succeeded in establishing his defence of mistaken delivery, which was supported by the evidence of other witnesses.

&gt; The court also concluded that the contested statements could not be relied upon to show that Ramadass had actual knowledge of the drugs.

The weight limit of each drug is determined by how much of it can kill a person if injested in one go.

The rationale of it then becomes somewhere along the lines of that since you brought in enough to kill a person, you deserve to die as well.

Where I stand on this is that if the offender knowingly commits the act while aware that the amount is sufficient to warrant the death penalty, then he asked for it.

&gt; The death penalty should not be abolished in Singapore, especially for crimes such as drug trafficking and terrorism (Protest against death penalty at reopened Speakers' Corner, April 4).

&gt; The death penalty acts as an effective deterrent to make potential criminals think twice, if not thrice, before committing any heinous crime.

&gt; Anti-death penalty activists must consider the destructive societal cost drug traffickers bring to many families in Singapore. The mental and health devastation that drug addicts and their families experience can be huge.

&gt; If drug traffickers valued their lives as well as others' lives as much as these activists do, they would not have committed the crimes. The monetary rewards are just too tempting, and so drug kingpins and traffickers will try their luck, especially in countries with lenient punishment.

&gt; Activists may want to be magnanimous towards people committing evil crimes, but some of these criminals show no tinge of guilt when bringing ruin to others.

&gt; Recent polls show that the majority of Singaporeans support the death penalty (Budget debate: Over 80% of S'poreans polled believe death penalty has deterred offenders, says Shanmugam, March 3).

&gt; Having the death penalty does not mean no crime, but having lenient punishment will not deter crime.

&gt; To keep the majority of Singaporeans safe, we need the death penalty.

If not for drugs, won't the addicts just switch to alcohol? Or other forms of addictions? I mean if the person really is broken, they'll find a way to get that escape, that dopamine hit, that rush of adrenaline - one way or the other.

And how many people are there for whom a life sentence is not enough of a deterrent, but a death penalty is? Honestly, for people who are that desperate for money or have lost all reason to live or were subject to abuse when young - death may actually be less of a deterrent. You go YOLO, you either succeed or get put out of your suffering. Either way, the suffering ends.

This isn't foreign influence, this is learning from experience. The US had it's capital punishment and war on drugs and learnt the hard way that if doesn't work.

Absent some horrific miscarriage of justice where some innocent gets hanged and this is later discovered, I don't see much change in the future.

More realistically, activists might want to address the *mandatory* death penalty for drug trafficking instead of DP as a whole.

&gt; SINGAPORE: Singapore can support 210 out of 324 recommendations it received in the United Nations (UN) Human Rights Council's universal periodic review (UPR), the country's Permanent Representative to the UN Office in Geneva, Ambassador Umej Bhatia said on Friday (Oct 1).

&gt; The outcome of the review, which happens every five years and is Singapore's third, was adopted on Friday.

&gt; Singapore's national statement during the adoption also addressed the Government's position on the death penalty, freedom of assembly, LGBT issues and the draft Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Bill.

&gt; ADOPTION OF RECOMMENDATIONS

&gt; Following the nation's UPR session on May 12, 2021, the inter-ministry committee on human rights has reviewed the 324 recommendations received, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Friday.

&gt; ""Singapore has supported the majority of recommendations consistent with our ongoing efforts to ensure that Singapore continues to be an inclusive, cohesive, and resilient society, taking into account the appropriateness of these recommendations to our national context,"" said the ministry.

&gt; In delivering Singapore's national statement at the adoption of the UPR outcome, Mr Bhatia said that for the recommendations that were noted, ""Singapore already has legislation and policies that address their underlying objectives in ways that best suit our unique social and cultural context"".

&gt; ""For example, the principle of equality of all persons before the law is already enshrined in the Singapore Constitution. We have laws and policies to protect our people from discrimination.""

&gt; Mr Bhatia added that Singapore is implementing policies to strengthen social safety nets and support various groups, including lower income Singaporeans, women, children, migrant workers, the elderly and people with disabilities.

&gt; ""We will continue to review and improve on our approach. For instance, the Government will study the views raised during the Conversations on Singapore Women’s Development, a national conversation series to gather feedback from Singaporeans on issues concerning women.""

&gt; Concrete proposals will be presented in a White Paper in Parliament in 2022, he added.

Not directly answering the question here but it’s pretty clear the elephant in the room has to be this: Is death penalty on drug trafficking ok?

I am against it for a myriad of reasons, though I’m not writing to elaborate on all of them. I would just like to point out some things to consider. 


(1) Debate over the death penalty frequently  ignores the other punitive measures available, such that it almost sounds like a question of “So do we execute him or let him go scot-free?” Given how serious the issue of drug trafficking is viewed in Singapore, punishments are not going  to be just light slips on the wrist. Hefty lengths in jail have shown to be effective deterrents, and most importantly, it gives room for appeals in the light of new evidence. There have been numerous cases of suspects prosecuted and given the death sentence, only to be acquitted on appeal. Can you imagine how many more might have possibly slipped through that net? 

(2) Proponents for the death penalty frequently cite the need to be tough on drugs, and not give way to becoming too lax. They would draw comparisons with other countries whereby being lax on drugs led to moral decadence and social dysfunction. 

That is a red herring. Many other complex factors should be considered. Authorities may be corrupted or afraid to act. The popular culture/sub-cultures may be more open to discussions of drug use. Law enforcement may be weak and unable to detect. Many factors are in play to create a lax culture that is open to drug use. The death penalty being imposed is definitely not the sole determining factor. 

What that means is, can we be tough on drugs without resorting to executing people?

(3) The dominant narrative in discussing these drug traffickers usually portray them as INDIVIDUAL evildoers that OWNSELF make the decision to traffick drugs. Cases are discussed in the news individually, and we tend to start thinking of it as a society vs individual sort of battle. 

This ignores the nuance that these traffickers are really the smallest fries in the game. Who are the suppliers? Where are the drugs produced from? Who are the coordinators? The drug lords?

To me, it’s really just that “because all life is great and precious” reason doesn’t cut it quite yet. 

You can go and tell the families who’ve lost people to drug problems that the drug dealers are allowed to get away because their lives are precious as well, but I believe that the backlash won’t really be ideal. And it entails more than just the person dying. This, I can say.

So, utility wise, if you’d have a bunch of people hanged, and what results is a lot less people having the risk of having to deal with substance abuse and its impacts, I’m okay with that. 

Just have to show the numbers that if we let the floodgates open here, locally, less people would be adversely affected than if we kept it closed, and I’ll be convinced that death penalty is a no.

It also largely depends on the cultural and historical context of the country as well.


We need to take a look at that point in time when it was instituted, how it was like, and the problems it solved. 

If back then, going to jail was just a simple matter of serving time, then we have the reason for the punishment - recurrent people who aren’t changed by the system. 

Though, if this form of reasoning won’t work today, because of how much society has advanced, the assumption behind this reasoning, I see, is that every person is educated enough, and knows better. It is something we must always bear in mind, I feel, if we were to progress from death penalty. I am looking for other points as well, so if you’d share, idm accepting the reason.

Personally, I’ve had relatives one generation above me dabble in substance abuse. I wasn’t born then (or was very young?), but not a good look for the extended families involved today. Dudes dieded. It’s still talked about today, and is one of the reasons for some things we do. Family business got affects a few years back, too, because of some idiot.

I can't help but feel for the applicant, Syed, here. Its sad that he can only resort to literally pleading for his life. But then again, one wonders, why mercy in this case and not others? What makes this case so special? And if the answer is that mercy should be shown in other cases as well, then that would make a nonsese out of the stipulated punishment (i.e. the death penalty). 

IMO the death penalty is a sentence for which the ""mercy"" argument simply has no part to play. The death penalty is either enforced or repealed. You can't have some in-between state of affairs where you have a death penalty but you show ""mercy"" in some cases but not others. It will be impossible to properly justify why in some cases we should show ""mercy"" and in others we should not. 

Also, I think Syed's strongest argument is probably the art 12 one. But even then, I don't really see how success on that argument should justify quashing of the punishment itself.

Because ""innocent"" could mean *completely* innocent in that not even one single element of the crime was satisfied (crimes generally have multiple elements and requirements, e.g. one lazy example, murder, has actus reus, mens rea, causation etc). 

""Innocent"" could also mean that the fact finder (i.e. the court) was perhaps wrong as to a particular finding, e.g. maybe the actus reus was there, but no mens rea (once more, I use the lazy example of murder, take it that accused stabbed the victim, causing death and so actus reus there, but maybe when accused stabbed the victim, accused was truly insane as to fall under s 84, however court found that accused was not insane). This is, in a sense, a form of ""innocence"", although the accused is not *that* innocent in that he did indeed stab the victim and cause death. 

""Innocent"" could also mean that the *sentence of death* was wrongly handed down but the *crime itself* was correctly established (i.e. all requirements met to appropriate standard of proof). Death penalty is not completely mandatory even for murder and drugs. I'll use the case of drugs since it is the most hotly debated on this forum. Even in the case of drug trafficking, the courts still have a discretion to sentence the accused to life imprisonment instead of death. The requirements are quite complex so I will just zoom in on one, i.e. the requirement that prosecutor certifies that accused provided info that substantively disrupted drug trafficking activities. 

In my example, I shall take it that accused was ""innocent"" in the sense that he did provide info, and the info did aid somewhat in ""disrupting *some* drug trafficking activity"", but prosecutor exercised his discretion and did not think that the info warranted issuing the cert (maybe he thought the info did not really help that much, or some other reason, who knows). In this case, I hope you can see that the prosecutor's decision whether to issue the cert or not is something that is *arguable both ways*. In other words, some might say accused was ""innocent"" as he provided enough info to warrant the cert, others might argue he was not as his info was not that useful. 

What all you ""innocence argument"" commenters are really referring to is (I think) the *first type of innocence*. I.e. hang a man for murder when in fact he was at home drinking kopi and killed no one. Such an outcome is perverse. It is also a catastrophic, complete, and comprehensive failure of the justice system, from judge to prosecutor, and all the way down to the police. That it would involve failure on such a grand degree logically means that such catastrophic failure is, by all accounts, *extremely* rare. Maybe it's 1/1 000 000 kind of rare. If you ask me, given the rarity of such failure,  the ""innocence argument"" then loses much of its strength as an argument for removal of the death penalty. 

Even so, there is the argument that perhaps the other two types of innocence are much more common (at least relative to the first type of innocence) and so the ""innocence argument"" retains much of its persuasive force. But imo, the riposte to that is simple. The second two types of ""innocence"" are much less clear cut than the first type. In both of those types of innocence, two perfectly reasonable people could probably find favour with arguments for and against innocence. In other words, the accused here is only *arguably* innocent. That being the case, can it *really* be said that we're sending an ""innocent-by-all-accounts"" man to the gallows?",singapore,13,t1_gawufqx

First. Death removes the opportunities to make amends or compensation to society and the victims. Giving a person life would at least help with reform a person to know where they did wrong and contribute to society through corrective works.


Second. Crimes are rarely black and white. A person could be suffering from mental conditions or being exploited by others. Perhaps being stretch to a breaking point, lead to a moment she can't reverse. Does she thus deserve death? Many mental issues were originally punished as crime before society becomes more progressive.


Third. I think as society we shape a person, and that person is a reflection of society. Consider that you are influence by your environment, some part of the blame could be society failings. An example would be crime of opportunities, where a person steals in order to put bread on the table.


Fourth. Death penalty is not effective as deterrent. And even if it was, I would argue the punishment is too hash for the crime. Consider north korea system of labor camp where family are punish for a person crime. Is it effective. I would think so, as it take certain committee to abandon their family. But is it fair? I don't think so. Similarly, the death penalty is overly punitive.


Fifth. Death penalty may actually cost the state more resources than life. This is because, there is usually multiple hearings and appeals. In the US death cost 1m more than life without parole. Going the converse route where an abundance of evidence / reputation of the prosecutor is also bad, as is happening in japan where cases rarely get overturned but many serious crime are also not convicted.",singapore,21,t1_gaw3bri

If you think that singapore's punishments aim at deterrence, consider the following. Why does singapore hang women but spare them from the cane? Wouldn't caning also deter women from certain crimes? This is inconsistent with deterrence as a policy. The answer is that the law is retributive, and because the laws ascribe women a lesser degree of moral agency, they are spared caning because it does not make sense to exact revenge upon a person with reduced moral agency.

&gt; Retributivists tended to be immune to the effects of information about the death penalty

This explains why most people in singapore still support the death penalty.

&gt; SINGAPORE — A 38-year-old Singaporean man and a 30-year-old Singaporean woman are being investigated by the police after they wore t-shirts bearing a message against the death penalty during the recent Yellow Ribbon Prison Run (YRPR).

&gt; In a statement on Tuesday (17 September), the police said they are investigating the duo for offences under the Public Order Act. A person who takes part in a public assembly or procession without a police permit may face a fine of up to $3,000 for a first offence upon conviction.

&gt; The police remind the public that there are proper avenues for Singaporeans to express their views on issues such as using the Speakers’ Corner.

&gt; In a separate statement, the event’s organising committee said it became aware that the man had registered for the event with “2ND CHANCES MEANS NOT KILLING THEM” printed on his running bib instead of his name.

&gt; The committee reached out to him twice on 6 September to explain that the event, which was held last Sunday, should not be used by him to advocate a cause and asked him to exchange the bib for one bearing his name. It also explained that if he fails to do so, he would be deregistered for the run. The man refused to change his bib.

&gt; When the committee reached out to him for a third time last Friday, the man agreed to exchange his bib for one bearing his name.

&gt; On the day of the event, the man and woman turned up at the venue wearing identical t-shirts with the words “2ND CHANCES MEANS NOT KILLING THEM” printed on the front of their own t-shirts, and the words “#ANTIDEATHPENALTY” printed on the back.

&gt; The committee told the man that he would not be allowed to participate in the run if he were to wear the t-shirt. It offered to provide him with another event t-shirt so that he can join the run.

&gt; The man rejected the offer, ripped off his bib and threw it on the ground. He ran separately by himself on the public road that ran alongside the running route. The woman left the venue.

&gt; At around 8.15am, the man reached the entrance to the Changi Prison Complex and the committee informed him that he would not be allowed into the premises. He stood outside the prison, and left at around 10am.

&gt; The committee said the event has helped rally public support for ex-offenders and their commitment to turn over a new lead. “The duo’s actions at this year’s YRPR are a disservice to offenders, ex- offenders and their families whom the Yellow Ribbon Project seeks to help,” it added.

What I was interested in was how much Heroin, in bulk, he was carrying (not the amount of pure heroin; he was determined to carry about 52g of pure heroin), how much he expected to earn from the sale and what his level in the supply chain was.

Turns out he was in the possession of about 1.5kg of Heroin no. 3. The purity of his merchandise was about 3.47% (this is some weak-ass shitty heroin. By comparison, the stuff typical in Thailand, for eg, is about [81%](https://www.unodc.org/unodc/secured/wdr/Prices_Opioids.pdf)).

According to the court document, he was supposed to break them up into 10 sets of 10 packets each and sell them for 800 SGD per set (or 80 SGD per packet). Each packet then should contain about 15g of Heroin no. 3 and 520mg of pure heroin. Thus the price is as follow:

\- 5.33 SGD/g of Heroin no. 3

\- 153 SGD/g of pure heroin (diamorphine).

With 520mg heroin per packet, one packet should be good for about 25 hits for a novice user (about 20mg/hit), but for a long-term user who has already build up tolerance, it can be as few as 3 hits (200mg/hit). Thus the cost per hit is anywhere from 3.2 to 27 SGD; depending on the tolerance.

Another interesting thing is the money he expected to get from his sale is closer to wholesale price than retail price. For eg, [this UN document](https://www.unodc.org/unodc/secured/wdr/Prices_Opioids.pdf) give the 2010 wholesale price of 3.7% pure Heroin no. 3 in Singapore to be 4.4k - 8k USD per pound. Convert to SGD (using Google data, which in 2010 ranged from 1.4 to 1.3 SGD to 1 USD, I will use 1.35 SGD to 1 USD), about 5.94 - 10.8k SGD. This guy is selling at around 2400 SGD per pound. Either he's really high up the wholesale supply chain or the price of heroin have really crashed.

This man lost his life over 8000 SGD worth of wholesale heroin. That's a really poor drug dealer. Turns out heroin is really cheap these days and it doesn't seem to be all that lucrative. Also, if you read news release on similar arrests and amounts seized, you may see things like ""the amount seized is worth 80-100k SGD on the street"". That's retail price. As you can see in this case, for someone having this much heroin, he stood to get as little as 1/10 or 1/20 of the retail value.

Drug crime doesn't really pay all that well, even without the risk of arrest, imprisonment, and execution.",singapore,73,t1_ezvn1of

&gt; A 59-year-old man was sentenced to death in the High Court after being found in possession of 52.75 g of diamorphine, also known as heroin, for the purpose of drug trafficking.

&gt; Justice Aedit Abdullah, in judgment grounds issued on Monday, held that the case against Sulaiman Jumari had been proven beyond reasonable doubt.

&gt; He found that Sulaiman had control over the room where he had been arrested and no one else would have had access to it, and the elements of the charge had been made out by the prosecution.

&gt; Sulaiman had been nabbed by Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) officers while alone in a rented room in Lorong 39 Geylang on June 23, 2016. The drugs, contained in 22 packets, were recovered from a wardrobe, a bedside table and a bed in the room.

&gt; At issue were three packets containing 49.86g of heroin inside a wardrobe drawer that did not have his DNA on them, unlike other exhibits. Sulaiman did not dispute possession of the other packets containing 2.89g of heroin recovered from the bedside table. But he claimed he did not know the three packets with 49.86g of heroin were in his room.

&gt; The Misuse of Drugs Act provides for the death penalty if the amount trafficked exceeds 15g.

&gt; He said other people had access to the room, including on the day he was arrested, and the packets could have been placed in the wardrobe drawer without his knowledge.

&gt; His defence lawyers, led by Mr Anand Nalachandran, further argued that the statement he gave at the time of his arrest should not be admitted, or it should be given minimal weight, alleging that Sulaiman had been induced to give it.

&gt; Related Story New figures affirm Singapore's decision to shift focus of drug laws to rehabilitation

&gt; Related Story Delivery driver given death penalty for drug trafficking

&gt; But the prosecution led by Deputy Public Prosecutor April Phang said Sulaiman had admitted clearly, in the statement he gave shortly after the drugs were discovered in his room, that the drugs in the three packets belonged to him, and he knew they contained heroin and were meant both for smoking and for sale.

&gt; Among other things, when asked by CNB officers if he had anything to surrender as he was placed under arrest, Sulaiman said ""three"" and gestured at the wardrobe. A search revealed the three packets.

&gt; The prosecution noted the drug trafficking paraphernalia found together with the quantity of drugs showed he meant to sell drugs.

&gt; Justice Aedit said no evidence was presented during the 11-day trial to support Sulaiman's version that the packets had been put in the wardrobe by someone else.

&gt; ""For someone to have left the (three packets) there without his knowing of it was beyond any reasonable belief,"" said the judge.

&gt; He also found that Sulaiman's statement at the time of arrest was not given as a result of any inducement or any adverse conditions.

&gt; Sulaiman, having been convicted, faces the death penalty unless he was a courier who had given substantive help to the authorities or was found to have mental abnormalities. ""As the accused was found to have had the drugs for sale, he did not qualify for the alternative sentencing regime, and accordingly the death sentence was passed against him,"" said Justice Aedit.

One theory that touches on this is the deterrence theory, whereby one aspect of it talked about how punishment cannot be too severe as well. If you're interested, you can read up on Cesare Beccaria deterrence theory, where he wrote: ""Excessive severity will not reduce crime, in other words, it will only increase crime.""

&gt; SINGAPORE: The police are investigating a 38-year-old man and a 30-year-old woman for offences under the Public Order Act, after they showed up at the Yellow Ribbon Prison Run on Sunday wearing T-shirts with messages against the death penalty.

&gt; The pair, both Singaporeans, wore T-shirts with the words ""2nd chances means not killing them"" printed on the front, and ""#antideathpenalty"" printed on the back.

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; A police report was made against them after the run on Sep 15.

&gt; ""It is a criminal offence under the Public Order Act to take part in a public assembly or procession without a police permit,"" said the Singapore Police Force (SPF) on Tuesday (Sep 17).

&gt; 

&gt; ""Investigations against the duo are ongoing.""

&gt; 

&gt; ATTEMPTS MADE TO CONTACT MAN BEFORE EVENT: PRISON SERVICE

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; The Yellow Ribbon Prison Run is an annual event organised in support of ex-offenders.

&gt; The man had said in a Facebook post that he was not allowed to run, ""despite (organisers) being clear on their site that runners can use any other tops other than their official T-shirt"".

&gt; ""First they told me I need to change my bib. Now they want to police me on what to wear,"" he said.

&gt; 

&gt; According to the event website, participants can run without wearing the designated jersey, but they have to put on number bibs with information such as names and emergency contact numbers.

&gt; In a statement on Tuesday, the Singapore Prison Service (SPS) said organisers found out more than a week before the event that the man had printed ""2nd chances means not killing them"" on his running bib instead of his name.

&gt; They contacted him about the matter several times before the race.

&gt; ""The Organising Committee contacted the man twice on Sep 6, 2019 to explain to him why his bib was inappropriate, as the YRPR (Yellow Ribbon Prison Run) should not be used by him as a platform to advocate other causes, or to campaign against existing laws,"" said SPS.

&gt; 

&gt; ""On both occasions, he rejected the Organising Committee’s offer despite being informed that he would be deregistered from the event and his registration fee refunded if he refused to change the bib.""

&gt; On Sep 13, organisers reached out to him again and agreed to his request to meet in person that night, said SPS. The man then exchanged his bib for one bearing his name.

&gt; However on the day of the event, the man and the woman showed up wearing identical yellow T-shirts with the anti-death penalty slogans. He was then informed that he would not be allowed to participate in the race, said SPS.

&gt; 

&gt; ""This was no different from his original intention to wear the running bib with the message printed on it, and as the organising committee had earlier advised him, it was inappropriate and not right for him to exploit the YRPR to advocate and campaign on his causes,"" SPS added.

&gt; 

&gt; The woman left the venue, while the man rejected organisers' offer to provide him with an event T-shirt, said SPS.

&gt; ""(He) ripped off his bib and threw it on the ground, and ran separately by himself on the public road that ran alongside the event running route,"" it added.

&gt; 

&gt; Upon reaching the end of the race route - at Changi Prison Complex - at about 8.15am, organisers told the man that he would not be allowed in.

&gt; He stood outside the prison and left at around 10am, said SPS.

&gt; ""The duo’s actions at this year’s YRPR are a disservice to offenders, ex-offenders and their families whom the Yellow Ribbon Project seeks to help,"" said the prison service.

&gt; 

&gt; Anyone convicted under the Public Order Act for taking part in a public assembly or procession without a police permit faced a fine of up to S$3,000.

&gt; ""The police would like to remind members of the public that there are proper avenues for Singaporeans to express their views on issues,"" SPF said.

&gt; ""For example, they can use the Speakers’ Corner to carry out public assemblies and speak on these issues, without the need for a permit, subject to certain conditions being met.""

Lots of times when there is a well known case in the news for the next drug trafficker saga, potentially the next capital case, there will always be people who seem to coldly wish for this person's death. I see 'String em up!', 'send him to the gallows!', 'you knew the rules!', etc etc. Being posted everywhere, or sometimes being said in conversations. Or after said person is executed and it pops up in the news, the same sort of sentiment is reflected as well.

Why??

I don't support the death penalty as i disagree with it deeply,but it is the law here and I don't see it changing. My support or disagreement is irrelevant to what I'm saying. I don't understand why are people that disturbingly for someone's death. This person has committed a crime in the eyes of singapore's law, and as such they will face a trial in which their life will hang in the balance depending on a multitude of factors. Is there a need to feel this 'superiority' and hope for this person's death? Why is there a need to pass such remarks hoping for this person to be sent to the gallows? What good does it do? It really disturbs me to read comments by people who not only support it, but turn it into some sort of gloatfest/circlejerk. 

I mean, this is not even about for or against, but just being less of a disgusting human being. If the accused is guilty and sentenced to death, then he/she's days are already numbered and the law has done it's part. Why be so happy about someone else's ( impending )death? ",singapore,7,t1_daxqh8r

The author conveniently dismisses Singapore's low drug use rates by claiming that there is ""missing"" data and under-reporting by the government. But despite complaining about data throughout the whole article, he failed to perform any actual analysis of the available data in his diatribe.

&gt; The only data Singapore does publish on drug use are figures on what it terms “drug abusers” – people who come into contact with the health or criminal justice system for drug treatment. Given that UNODC estimates the number of people who require treatment globally is only 10% of all people who use drugs, we can see how these government figures (even if accurate) are a dramatic under-representation of levels of drug use in a country.

Let's suppose the 10% figure cited by the author is correct. CNB says that there were [3089 drug abusers](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/number-of-drug-abusers-arrested-falls-in-2017-cnb-9927886) arrested in 2018. If we extrapolate this with the author's 10% figure, this means that there are approximately 30890 drug users in Singapore, which is **0.5%** of Singapore's 5.6 million population.

How does this compare to the US? According to the CDC, [10.1%](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/drug-use-illegal.htm) of people are illicit drug users. This means that even after correcting for the supposed under-reporting with the author's own standards, there is still at least a 20-fold difference in the rates of drug usage in Singapore vs US.

&gt; 
&gt; Speaking before the country’s parliament, Singapore’s minister for home affairs, K Shanmugam, extolled the country’s success in fighting drugs. He attributed these results to Singapore’s harsh drug laws, which include the use of capital punishment.
&gt; 
&gt; It may seem surprising to the uninitiated that Singapore has the death penalty for drug crimes. But, as the minister said: “Our penalties are severe because we want to deter such offences”.
&gt; 
&gt; Singapore is one of a tiny number of countries classified by Harm Reduction International (HRI) as “high application” states in the use of capital punishment for drugs. This means that death sentences and executions are a regular part of the criminal justice system. Indeed, there have been two executions for drug offences just this month, killings which were condemned by UN human rights officials.
&gt; 
&gt; The idea that harsh drug laws such as the death penalty are effective is one actively promoted by Singapore. And it is a belief now allegedly being adopted by US president Donald Trump. Given Trump’s notorious concern with what he considers “fake news”, it is somewhat surprising he has embraced one of the more dubious claims in global drug control – the myth that Singapore’s harsh penalties have nearly eliminated drug use and drug crime.
&gt; 
&gt; **The Singapore myth**  
&gt; Singapore consistently claims that it has one of the lowest rates of drug use in the world. Yet the government does not publish reliable data on drug use, making this statement impossible to independently verify.
&gt; 
&gt; As far back as 2008, the reference group to the United Nations on HIV and injecting drug use found Singapore to be one of the only countries in Asia without reliable data on rates of drug injecting. More recently in 2016, HRI published its global state of harm reduction, which similarly found almost no reliable data on levels of drug use in Singapore.
&gt; 
&gt; Instead, the government typically cites information from the world drug report, published annually by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). However, rather than being independently produced, this report reflects data provided by governments.
&gt; 
&gt; This practice – which I have long referred to as data laundering – puts a UN seal of legitimacy on Singaporean government data that is at best unverified, and at worst politically expedient. UNODC admits that the vast disparity in data quality and collection methods between countries “affect the reliability, quality and comparability” of the data in the report, making comparisons between countries of little value.
&gt; 
&gt; Even the Singaporean minister’s recent speech did not offer any figures on drug-related crime, sticking instead to a few emotive stories about the “dangers of drugs”. The government’s failure to provide transparent data creates huge doubts about any claims of effectiveness, and raises the question of whether their statements represent anything more than political “spin” to justify controversial drug policies.
&gt; 
&gt; **Missing data**  
&gt; The only data Singapore does publish on drug use are figures on what it terms “drug abusers” – people who come into contact with the health or criminal justice system for drug treatment. Given that UNODC estimates the number of people who require treatment globally is only 10% of all people who use drugs, we can see how these government figures (even if accurate) are a dramatic under-representation of levels of drug use in a country.
&gt; 
&gt; What about Singapore’s success in reducing drug-related crime? As with data on drug use, published figures on drug-related crime are neither robust nor transparent, again making such claims impossible to independently verify. The annual statistical crime brief published by the Singapore police force does not provide any data on drug-related offences. Nor does the annual report of Singapore’s central narcotics bureau – an odd omission given the bureau’s practice of regularly reporting major trafficking arrests on its website.
&gt; 
&gt; This lack of data certainly does not reflect a lack of crime. The government admits 80% of people in prison are drug offenders. This, coupled with the fact that Singapore has the seventh highest rate of incarceration per capita in Asia, does not mesh easily with the government’s claims of low levels of drug-related crime either.
&gt; 
&gt; Interestingly, what the narcotics bureau’s 2016 report does show is that seizures of both methamphetamine and cannabis increased by approximately 20% over the previous year, while heroin seizures remain basically level. Hardly indicators of a shrinking drug market.
&gt; 
&gt; Clearly the statistics used to promote the Singapore myth either do not exist, or fall apart under scrutiny. As a result, any attempt to use the Singapore model as evidence of the effectiveness of the death penalty for drug offences is ludicrous. Given the unprecedented overdose crisis in the US, Americans deserve an evidence-based response. Pursuing myth-based drug policies will only make the problem worse.",singapore,2,t1_dvzhqiq

&gt; SINGAPORE - Singapore should end harassment of peaceful activists, Human Rights Watch has said, after participants at a candlelight vigil for a man being executed for drug trafficking were stopped from leaving the country.

&gt; The Singapore government has said that the law is required to provide for the individual&amp;#039;s rights for political expression without compromising on &amp;quot;Order and safety&amp;quot;.

&gt; Among those at the vigil were a journalist, who is an activist against capital punishment, an editor of independent online blog &amp;quot;Online Citizen&amp;quot; and a filmmaker whose most recent work focused on the detention in 1987 of political activists under Singapore&amp;#039;s Internal Security Act.

The TL;DR version of it is that in most cases, hanging is still mandatory, but courts are now given leeway in  sentencing. The man's lawyer must've given a fantastic ""My client is a moron, and bears no malice"" defence.

This comes in the wake of Amnesty International's document - [Singapore: The Death Penalty - A Hidden Toll Of Executions](http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ASA36/001/2004/en/6de04440-d64e-11dd-ab95-a13b602c0642/asa360012004en.html) about our continuing support of the death penalty for serious offences [(many points of which we've already rebuked)](http://www.mha.gov.sg/basic_content.aspx?pageid=74). As usual, it took two election cycles to address, but hey, we're there now.

Personally, while I think many of our laws are quite harsh, many items can be called ""anti-asshole laws"", where a person is punished for the (perceived) harm they do to others. Murder? Yeah, you just ended another person's life, so the death penalty. Ditto for terrorism, treason, and unlawful discharge of firearms (which is the only reason why SAR-21 guy is still alive and serving a 9 year prison sentence. Good thing he didn't shoot, eh?).

In a similar vein, if someone were involved in the trafficking of a large amount of drugs, enough to really mess up the lives of a large number of people, he/she should be punished in a manner that reflects the severity of the crime. Everyone coming to Singapore is made aware of this, and there should be no excuse apart from an inability to understand their actions (see again: moron defence). Here, I think, is where the courts are given leeway in sentencing, which is for the better.

On a completely unrelated note, we've had two cases of guys smuggling rifles and ammo out of camp in the last 30 years, and both guys were Teos (Dave Teo, the SAR-21 guy, and Teo Yong Kuan, who brought an AR-15 out in 1986). Hah! I spot a pattern here!",singapore,14,t1_clod8bx

&gt; For drug trafficking cases, the Government has proposed to make the death penalty for drug trafficking no longer mandatory but to be imposed at the discretion of the courts, if two conditions are met, said Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean in Parliament today.

&gt; First, the trafficker must have only played the role of courier, and must not have been involved in any other activity related to the supply or distribution of drugs. 

&gt; Second, discretion will only apply if - having satisfied this first requirement - either the trafficker has cooperated with the Central Narcotics Bureau in a substantive way, or he has a mental disability which substantially impairs his appreciation of the gravity of the act.

It *sounds* much better than what we used to have, but I have questions about whether or not it really is. For e.g., what amounts to ""substantive"" cooperation with CNB? DPM Teo suggests that ""substantive"" cooperation is results based:

&gt; First, it is aimed at getting couriers to give substantive cooperation leading to concrete outcomes, such as the dismantling of syndicates or the arrest or prosecution of syndicate members, that will help in the broader enforcement effort.

t1,g6amgsj,t3_iy1h4k,2020-09-23 06:15:14,tactical_feeding,"The biggest argument against drugs is not just its overall delitibating effect on health, but how addictive it is to the point where you will to go great lengths to procure your next hit. That's the main reason why drugs are not as controlled as cigarettes or alcohol

The people who fall into drug abuse AND subsequently fall into the role of drug mules are primarily the ones who don't have the financial means to upkeep their habit. Either that, or the drug mule was already in an unsustainable financial situation (no income, or debt) and saw drug muling as a quick and easy way to resolve their debt issues/ get ""rich"" quick while not doing very much. In both cases, there is no logical weighing of the pros and cons. You can't go to the drug dealer and say, hey I only want to mule so-and-so amount so that if I get caught the penalty is lower; you mule whatever amount of whatever drugs you are given. 

As for legalising drugs, ok here's my wistfully-educated take on it; we generally live in societies where we are urged to be law-abiding, ""pliant"", and productive citizens. To that end, on a personal and societal level you are urged to continue onto a lifelong climb up to educate, upskill yourself to be valuable to whatever profession you're in. Drugs, recreational or hard drugs, erode that ambition and work ethic, both on an individual and societal level. 

Cigarettes and alcohol also do so, but on a smaller level. But precisely because ciggs and alcohol seem to have a lower immediate impact (cause seemingly not THAT addictive and harmful to health in the short term), people end up developing a ciggs/ alcohol habit. Economically speaking, think of how much a pack a day adds up to; thats how much its taken off your earnings - consumption that is ultimately unproductive and even harmful to health (as compared to spending on anything else). Now take this paragraph; drugs do this on a totally different level because of how satifying and addictive it is. 

It can be argued that consuming recreational drugs might have a positive effect on mental health (stress reduction). But we know for sure that especially for the subset of the working population who may not be inclined to trek that lifelong climb, they just wna have a chill life maybe engage in the SMOKE WEED EVERYDAY subculture, you totally erode whatever remnant of productivity and ambition, they are just going to stay in that certain strata of society as long as they want to.

Magnify that to a whole population, and it is easy to see why Singapore or even Asian countries would be extremely resistant to legalising recreational drugs - it goes against the ""typical"" Asian culture of industriousness and society/ community above self. As opposed to Western cultures where the emphasis is on personal sovereignty, free will, civil rights (therefore less clampdown on recreational drugs cause MUH BODY). 

Western cultures HAVE tried to push back on this, but the political pressures were chiefly religious in nature (we can cite American Prohibition as an example; the overriding force came from religion. A good number of politicians were reluctant to enforce it, going to great lengths to procure large quantities of alcohol themselves, or at least doctors who would issue them medical prescriptions for them to exploit loopholes)

Just my opinion on why this MIGHT be the rationale behind not legalising recreational drugs. The argument of recreational drugs being a slippery slope into hard drugs... ehhh i dun rly buy it in Singapore's context but I could see how it might snowball into a huge societal concern in less disciplined societies, especially in countries where theres a urban-rural divide, or cultural enclaves, that eventually turn it into a YOU'RE JUS DISCRIMINATING/ OPPRESSING us when the hard facts may simply be that that specific society is not as competitive as it could be, if not for stratification followed by decline in economic potential, exacerbated by drug use and the cost of vice that follows.",singapore,17,t1_g6amgsj

&gt; Law and home affairs minister K Shanmugam said the massacre that recently took place at a childcare centre in Thailand is an example of why Singapore has such strict drug laws.

&gt; Shanmugam noted in a Facebook post on Oct. 11 that the perpetrator of the shooting, 34-year-old former policeman Panya Khamrab, was facing a methamphetamine drug charge when he carried out the attack.

&gt; According to media reports, Panya was dismissed from the police force in 2021 over drug allegations.

&gt; He was also in court for a drug charge on the morning of the attack, which left at least 38 dead, including 24 children.

&gt; Panya had reportedly not quit from his habit of taking drugs since he was fired from the force, The Straits Times wrote.

&gt; The silence of activists: Shanmugam

&gt; Shanmugam pointed out that those who disapprove of Singapore's severe stance on drugs have purportedly been silent.

&gt; ""The silence, of narco liberals and apologists for drug traffickers, is deafening. Some are probably hoping that the link between drugs and the violence will be overlooked. And as far as I know, these activists have not held any candle light vigil for the children who have been massacred.""

&gt; He also highlighted Thailand's move to clamp down on drugs following the mass shooting.

&gt; Thailand’s Prime Minister, Prayuth Chan-Ocha, has made drug suppression an urgent national agenda item and ordered police to proactively crack down on illicit substances, reported Bloomberg.

&gt; To do so, police will conduct random drug searches, arrest offenders, and bring in drug users for rehabilitation.

&gt; However, Shanmugam wondered how such measures will pan out considering the ""wide availability of drugs"" there.

&gt; Referring to Thailand's move to legalise cannabis in June 2022, he added:

&gt; ""At least one death penalty activist was celebrating Thailand’s move, with the implied suggestion that we were wrong in our policies. At that time we were asked if we would follow Thailand’s example. I said no.""

&gt; Good reasons

&gt; Shanmugam also cited a stabbing attack in Canada in September 2022, which left 10 dead, and where one of the perpetrators had a history of drug and alcohol abuse, and associations with gang members and drug dealers.

&gt; The minister concluded:

&gt; ""I cannot emphasise this enough – there are good reasons why Singapore maintains a tough stance towards drug consumption and trafficking.""

t1,jiexvk5,t3_1348x6w,2023-05-01 10:24:28,levixtrival,"SAN FRANCISCO — Last year, with pandemic lockdowns in the rearview mirror, Whole Foods Market made a bet on a gritty San Francisco neighborhood. The high-end supermarket chain opened a giant flagship store in a part of the city that is home to both tech companies like Twitter and open-air drug dealing.

But the store was soon confronted head-on with many of the problems plaguing the area. People threatened employees with guns, knives and sticks. They flung food, screamed, fought and tried to defecate on the floor, according to records of 568 emergency calls over 13 months, many depicting scenes of mayhem.

“Male w/machete is back,” the report on one 911 call states. “Another security guard was just assaulted,” another says. A man with a four-inch knife attacked several security guards, then sprayed store employees with foam from a fire extinguisher, according to a third.

In September, a 30-year-old man died in the bathroom from an overdose of fentanyl, a highly potent opioid, and methamphetamine.

When Whole Foods announced in mid-April that it was closing the store, citing the safety of its employees, many in San Francisco saw it as a representation of some of the city’s most intractable problems: property crimes like shoplifting and car break-ins, an entrenched network of dealers selling fentanyl and other illicit drugs and people suffering from untreated mental illness wandering the streets.",SingaporeRaw,0,t1_jiexvk5

The reasoning that the punishment is justified because drug traffickers also ""murder"", is not valid. There is no direct cause (only indirect) to the death of the abuser, as the abuser has agency over his/her actions. Education is key to prevent these abusers from hurting themselves or others through the consumption of drugs. Case in point, alcohol. Do we hang alcohol company CEOs for providing alcohol to the masses, which then indirectly leads to the ""murder"" of innocents through drink driving? No we don't, because it is not directly their fault but it is on the consumer that chose to drink, and to drive.

That being said, harsh punishments should exist for drug traffickers, just not hanging. Whether we have not enough space or not enough money to support these harsh punishments is another topic. What's being discussed is a human right issue.

Calling out others ""in the West"" for imposing their values on other societies... how about SG imposing extraterritorial drug consumption laws on not just Singaporeans returning from abroad, but also SGPRs holding foreign citizenship returning to SG?

Calling out a Brit for having no moral rights to lecture on drugs due to his country's history of the Opium Wars... how about SG having no moral rights to lecture on freedom of speech from others outside of SG with different views and opinions because SG is a country which would attempt to put an activist into jail for holding a smiley face placard in front of a police station, or defining one person standing outside of court holding a slogan placard as an ""illegal assembly"" protest?

By removing capital punishment, we may see an uptake of drug abusers in Singapore. If they die of overdose, then probably it would be the end of story for them or they can finance their habit or kick away the habit, then the impact would be minimum.

But for those who can't control their habits, the damage to society and their loved ones are something that thoughts and prayers and liberal rights can't heal.

Imagine a drug abuser needs his next fix but he does not have the money to pay from it. So he 'borrows' from parents, siblings, relatives, spouses, children and friends. Soon his/her goodwill with loved ones run out or they have no more money to give. They get desperate and start committing petty crimes. Then it escalates, finding a knife to threaten victims on the street to give their valuables. Or they smash shop windows to reach the cashier or steal anything of value. One time, it all goes wrong, a victim puts up a struggle and gets stabbed and dies. The abuser is not thinking straight, all he/she cares about is getting the next fix.

How many victims can 1 drug abuser potentially create? Take a count, the loved ones that lose money and see the abuser wasting their life, the innocent business owners that get their property raided? The other victims that are only guilty that they were walking alone that result in them being robbed or killed?

Now relax the law allowing more drug traffickers to test the border security.

How many fold increment in drug abusers can the society handle?

As more evidence is revealed, either through time, or the advancement of technology, more and more people have been exonerated for the things they didn't actually do. The list of exonerations is depressingly high (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wrongful_convictions_in_the_United_States) and the estimated statistic of 4% executed being innocent, 1 out of 25 people, is 17 times more likely than striking 4D on any number (even the consolation ones).

The general consensus in this thread is that those who are on death row deserves it. But our justice system is not infallible, and none of us here are truly omniscient.

The reason why having death penalty is a good deterrence is because the outcome of not having death penalty will allow more drug production and related activities to happen inland. Currently, people can’t see the the drugs being cooked within our land because it’s far too risky for them to be doing that. 

Remove the death penalty and you’ll be seeing diamorphine being transported into Singapore like they are vegetables. Death penalty ultimately still put a resistance on people who treasure life over death. 

Those who are persuaded into trafficking have the choice to make during their smuggling operation to turn themselves in and collaborate with the police. If they choose to continue with the smuggling and trafficking it does say that they have the mental capacity to choose to help in the act of smuggling the drugs. 

The other pointer made was to imprison these people, but it should not be the case. Taxpayers are not liable for people who commit crimes. Taxpayers money are often put to forward the country, but if we start giving life imprisonment to every single drug dealer in Singapore, the expenses are bound to go up whether the activist choose to deny it or not. Putting 1 person in life time imprisonment versus 10 people, the 10 people obviously will cost more than the 1 person. 

Everything boils down to choices, just like what the video “inside the fentanyl crisis” mentioned. It all comes down to their own choice. They made the decision to go into the drug trade, they should bear the consequence of drug trade.

As for murderers, why are we trying to rehabilitate murderers. There are so many examples of murderers walking free and reoffending within the next few years. Either more lives are lost or more damage are done to the society.

[44 days in hell](https://japaninsides.com/44-days-of-hell-the-story-of-junko-furuta/) is a good case to show that rehabilitation doesn’t always work. The guy was sentence to jail and within a few years out of prison he was out causing trouble again. You would think that prison made him realize killing is wrong, but the guy literally went out and broke the law again. 

There are so many other crime stories from the USA, where the guy walked free when he had murder charge on his shoulder. Only for him to be released and kill again immediately. [deemed too old to murder, murders again.](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna1031736)

Taiwan as an example, is a country where they don't actively enforce the death penalty, and prefers to pursue a ""redemption"" approach, and a lot of those that did their sentence, or were let out earlier into society due to good behavior come out to do the exact same thing that they went in for, and some of these cases are really horrific.

It really isn't about whether you think some people deserve to die, this isn't about that, it's about the power of the government. The government simply shouldn't have the right to put people to death because such a practice is ripe for abuse. If the government falsely incriminates someone they don't like and use the death penalty to execute them, well, that's it. Even if the lie is exposed later on, that person is dead.

On top of that, the death penalty is a costly law to maintain. It takes more money to put someone to death than to keep them in prison for life,because putting someone to death is a costly process involving multiple appeals and tons of beauracracy, and if we remove said beauracracy, then innocent people will be killed.

Lastly, overusing the death penalty will lead to more crime.

As you rightly pointed out, the deed has been done, and the dead cannot be returned to life. However, what it offers is a sense of closure to the victim's loved ones. It's easy to be a by-stander and argue against the death penalty for murder, but what if you were the victim's family member? As for a life sentence, it's honestly a waste of taxpayers' money to keep a murderer alive. The point is simple: if you deny an innocent being's right to live, you don't deserve to live anymore. And if this point does not deter someone from committing murder, then just be prepared to face the consequences.

As for the death sentence for drug trafficking, it's not solely about the seriousness of the individual crime, but the long-term consequences that society will have to deal with. Drug use is extremely addictive: while small quantities may have medical effects, one must be disciplined to prevent oneself from spiralling out of control. Whether or not this warrants the death penalty is certainly worthy of debate.

Consuming it in Singapore is one thing - trying to bring it into Singapore is another. As for death penalty - I'm pretty sure its only the traffickers who gets it (might be wrong). If you consume drugs (be it 'hard' like coke of soft like 'weed') in Singapore you probably just gonna get sent to rehab or get jail time/fine. You wont get death penalty. 

If you try to bring it into Singapore (aka trafficking/smuggling), then its a whole other story that honestly shouldn't involve the whole 'should weed be legalised in sg' debate. Like come on, which country in the world will allow you to bring drugs (from another country) into their country? US legalised weed. Its still illegal to transport into their country. Try it. You'd most probably get deported + banned. If studies have shown that weed ain't even that harmful/less harmful than alcohol etc etc then why do countries make it highly illegal for you to 'traffick' cannabis into their country?

'But death penalty is too harsh/other countries dont have death penalty'. Yeah cause of factors like 1. They already have weed there so if you manage to smuggle it it wont really make an impact. sg doesnt have weed. 2. Our neighbouring countries are economically poorer (+ they have steady supply) than us so obviously more will try their luck if punishment is lax. If they even manage to make 1 delivery then its quite worth. If not? At max just get deported/jailed lorh. 3. Land size. Sg is a small country w/ limited land size. We wont have enough prisons if our too lax measures lead to more people trying to traffick and end up getting convicted in jail as a result.

Many countries have legalized weed because it's clearly not a very harmful substance. It is not as toxic nor as addicting as alcohol, and it can be safely used recreationally and medicinally for chronic pain.

https://drugabuse.com/blog/marijuana-vs-alcohol/

Singapore's main stance is derived from viewing MJ as a gateway drug to other more harmful drugs like cocaine or heroin. The fear is that if MJ is legal, rampant use could lead to people getting into harder drugs to the detriment of society. However, I argue that this point can be sustained without sentencing MJ traffickers and users to death. Perhaps there can be a very conservative ceiling on the amount a person can consume or carry, and heavily-regulated supply chains and stores for buying and consumption. People who flout the law could be sentenced to jail / caning as per other serious offences. Furthermore, while some research note that some MJ users do go on to use harder drugs, most do not. Heightened response to other drugs is also not unique to MJ - alcohol causes such a response too.

Secondly, some unethical/immoral/escalating actions are also illegal. Eg Intentionally Blocking a person's way, not flushing toilets, and spitting in public. Which means that the public areas are safe and clean.

&gt; SINGAPORE: In mid-September, a 22-year-old man was sentenced to life imprisonment and caning for stabbing a stranger to death while they were both jogging in Punggol.

&gt; Surajsrikan Diwakar Mani Tripathi was charged with murder under Section 300(c), which is punishable either by death or life imprisonment with caning.

&gt; In the aftermath, several readers asked what made the difference - why was Surajsrikan spared the death penalty? CNA spoke to lawyers to find out what goes into deciding if an offender gets sentenced to death or to life imprisonment.

&gt; Are there different ""degrees"" of murder?

&gt; The death sentence used to be mandatory until January 2013, when the Penal Code (Amendment) Act 2012 (Act 32 of 2012) came into operation, said Ms A Meenakshi, an associate at IRB Law.

&gt; The amendment allowed the court to have the discretion to sentence a person to life imprisonment with caning instead of death for certain murder offences.

&gt; The first factor that determines whether an accused person receives the death penalty or life imprisonment is the selection of the charge against him or her, said Mr Johannes Hadi, partner at Eugene Thuraisingam LLP.

&gt; ""The Penal Code sets out a hierarchical rubric for the categorisation of homicide offences,"" he explained.

&gt; At the top of this hierarchy is Section 300(a) – murder with the intention to cause death. This is the most serious and carries the mandatory death penalty, said Mr Hadi.

&gt; ""This means that if one is convicted of a Section 300(a) charge, the only possible sentence is death.""

&gt; There are three other types of murder offences: Section 300(b), (c) and (d). Section 300(b) is where the act is done with the intention of causing a bodily injury that the offender knows is likely to cause death.

&gt; Section 300(c) is if the act is done with the intention to cause bodily injury to a person, and the injury intended is sufficient to cause death. Section 300(d) is where the person committing the act knows it is so imminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause death or an injury likely to cause death, and commits such an act without any excuse for incurring the risk of death.

&gt; Anyone convicted of these three offences can be sentenced either to death or to life imprisonment and caning.

&gt; SINGAPORE - A man facing a capital charge for trafficking 27 packets of heroin claimed in his defence that the drugs in the heaviest packet were for his personal consumption.

&gt; If Chong Hoon Cheong had succeeded in his consumption defence, he would have avoided the gallows, as the amount of heroin in the other packets was under the 15g legal threshold for the imposition of the mandatory death penalty.

&gt; On Tuesday (July 5), the Court of Appeal rejected Chong's consumption defence and upheld his death sentence imposed by the High Court last year.

&gt; Chong, who is now 61, was arrested on Dec 8, 2015, at his rented room in Hamilton Road in Jalan Besar.

&gt; He was charged with trafficking 27 packets of granular and powdery substances weighing a total of 848.69g, which were analysed and found to contain a total of 25.01g of pure heroin.

&gt; He claimed that a packet containing 448.7g of a brown granular substance - found to contain not less than 14.08g of pure heroin - was for his own consumption.

&gt; On Tuesday, the apex court noted that Chong's reported rate of heroin consumption ""implausibly and dramatically increased"" from the time of his arrest in 2015 to his trial in 2020.

&gt; In December 2015, Chong told Central Narcotics Bureau officers that he consumed about 4g of heroin each day.

&gt; A few weeks earlier, he told a doctor that he took 5g to 6g a day.

&gt; During his trial in 2020, Chong initially testified in March that he took 16g to 20g of heroin a day.

&gt; Towards the end of the trial, in November that year, he claimed that he consumed between 20g to 25g of heroin a day - approaching five to six times his original claim.

&gt; ""There is no explanation for this rapidly inflating account of his rate of consumption, which inevitably means that it will be viewed with considerable doubt,"" said the Court of Appeal in its written judgment.

&gt; The apex court agreed with the lower court that while Chong is not expected to recall his consumption rates with scientific precision, what was concerning is that his alleged consumption rate increased fivefold over the course of the investigation and trial.

&gt; ""That significant discrepancy was unaccounted for at the trial below, and remains unaccounted for before us,"" said the judgment written by Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon.

&gt; SINGAPORE: A man who imported 1kg of cannabis from Malaysia into Singapore three years ago is set to hang after his appeal against conviction and sentence was dismissed by the Apex Court on Tuesday (Oct 12).

&gt; Singaporean Omar Yacob Bamadhaj, 41, was sentenced to death in February this year after being convicted of one count of importing into Singapore three bundles containing at least 1kg of cannabis in 2018.

&gt; He was nabbed during a routine check at Woodlands Checkpoint past midnight on Jul 12, 2018. His father, who did not know about the drugs, was at the wheel.

&gt; When asked about the three bundles wrapped in aluminium foil, cling wrap and newspaper in the boot of the car, Omar said they contained ""plants for herbs"".

&gt; The prosecution's case is that Omar pre-ordered the Class A drugs on Jul 10, 2018 and collected them a day later near a mosque in Malaysia.

&gt; Omar's defence at trial was that he did not know the nature of the bundles at the time. He claimed his acquaintances, known as Din and Latif, had placed the bundles in his bag without his knowledge.

&gt; Omar and his father left Singapore on Jul 11, 2018 to buy groceries and to perform their evening prayers at a mosque. After that, Omar dropped his father off at his brother's school for an event, while he himself went to run errands.

&gt; While at a car wash, he met two of his acquaintances, Din and Latif. Latif asked Omar to bring three bundles wrapped in newspapers into Singapore, and Omar initially said he did not want to take the risk.

&gt; In a statement Omar gave to the police on the day of his arrest, he said the deal was for S$500 per bundle. He said he knew the ""green"" was marijuana, and contemplated for 20 minutes before accepting the deal as he was ""desperate for money"".

&gt; However, in later statements, he denied knowledge of what the bundles were, claiming that Din or Latif had placed the bundles in his car without his knowledge.

&gt; On Tuesday, Omar's lawyer Hassan Esa Almenoar said there was reasonable doubt as to whether Omar imported the drugs deliberately or not, and said it was ""difficult to conclude that he planned all this"".

&gt; ALLEGED COERCION BY CNB OFFICERS

&gt; Omar had argued that the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) officers had ""coerced"" him into giving admissions. He claimed that an officer threw a pen at him, and threatened him and said: ""If you refuse to admit to this, I will throw both you and your father to be hanged"".

&gt; However, Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon said it was ""difficult"" to see how Omar's two earliest statements were ""involuntary"". He pointed out that notwithstanding the allegation that the first officer had threatened Omar, the second statement was taken by a different officer, with Omar divulging more details of how and why he imported the drugs.

&gt; Omar only pulled back from his admissions five days after giving those statements, said the Chief Justice, who heard the case along with Justices Andrew Phang and Chao Hick Tin.

&gt; Omar's new version of events was that his mind ""went blank"" when his car was stopped at Woodlands Checkpoint and the three bundles were uncovered.

&gt; In a subsequent statement, the officer questioned Omar as to the disparities in his statements. When asked why there were differences in his accounts, Omar replied: ""I said that because I was not at the right state of mind. I was feeling high from the stick I had smoked with Din. High to me is like being semi-conscious.""

&gt; The Chief Justice pointed out that if Omar had really been coerced by the officer, this was when he should have said so.

&gt; After deliberating the case, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, saying they were satisfied that the trial judge had examined the case carefully.

&gt; SINGAPORE: Judgment was reserved in the case of convicted Malaysian drug dealer Nagaenthran Dharmalingam's last-minute defence against his execution at the Court of Appeal on Tuesday (Mar 1).

&gt; Nagaenthran is appealing against a High Court decision that dismissed his bid to commence judicial review proceedings on the basis that he purportedly possesses the mental age of someone below 18.

&gt; The appeal was heard by a panel of five judges: Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon, Justice Andrew Phang Boon Leong, Justice Judith Prakash, Justice Belinda Ang and Justice Chao Hick Tin.

&gt; The crux of the appellant's arguments was that Nagaenthran is not competent for execution as he has an intellectual disability. His lawyer, Ms Violet Netto, cited medical reports, international treaty obligations and customary international law to argue this.

&gt; The hearing started 15 minutes late as the court waited for Ms Netto to arrive, and lasted for more than an hour.

&gt; At the start of the hearing, Chief Justice Menon admonished Ms Netto for keeping the Court of Appeal waiting and for tendering a new medical report to the court that morning, just before the judges entered the courtroom.

&gt; ""This appears to be an abuse of process, this appears to be calculated to delay the resolution of this matter,"" he said.

&gt; Ms Netto apologised and said she had to attend to her medical problems. She was accompanied by lawyer Ravi Madasamy, better known as M Ravi, who previously represented Nagaenthran.

&gt; She received permission from the court for Mr Ravi to give her ""technical support"" by handing her documents. He also appeared to be whispering into her ear at many points in the hearing, including during delivery of her oral arguments.

&gt; ""INDEPENDENT"" ASSESSMENT AND PRISON MEDICAL REPORT

&gt; Ms Netto sought two outcomes. First, she asked the court to order an ""independent"" psychiatric assessment of Nagaenthran and ""up-to-date full neurocognitive test"" to evaluate his competence to be executed and for the necessary treatment to be prescribed.

&gt; She also asked for adequate time for Nagaenthran to find an ""independent psychiatrist willing and able to undertake an assessment"".

&gt; She referred to a new medical report by Dr Danny Sullivan that the appellant received on Sunday and submitted to the court on Tuesday morning.

&gt; In it, she said he supported the proposal for a panel of psychiatric experts to provide a ""conjoint opinion and clarify areas of disagreement"". She also cited medical reports by two other overseas experts.

&gt; Second, she asked that an existing medical and psychiatric assessment of Nagaenthran, which is in the possession of the Singapore Prison Service, be provided ""directly and confidentially"" to the appellant and with his consent, to her and his family.

&gt; Nagaenthran was sentenced to death in 2010 for importing 42.72g of heroin into Singapore in 2009 in a bundle strapped to his thigh. He failed in his appeals to the High Court in 2011, to the Apex Court in 2019 and in his petition to the president for clemency.

&gt; He was to have launched this appeal in November last year but was given a stay of execution on Nov 9, one day before he was scheduled to hang, after testing positive for COVID-19.

&gt; His case has attracted international attention. There was a full public gallery and several members of the media were in attendance on Tuesday.

&gt; SINGAPORE - The appeal of Malaysian drug trafficker Nagaenthran K. Dharmalingam, which was scheduled to be heard on Monday (Jan 24), has been adjourned.

&gt; The Straits Times understands that Nagaenthran's new lawyer, Ms Violet Netto, who took over the case from Mr M. Ravi, had applied for the adjournment.

&gt; He is appealing against a High Court decision denying him permission to start judicial review proceedings to challenge his execution.

&gt; No new hearing date has been fixed.

&gt; The hearing was slated to be heard by a five-judge panel comprising Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon and Justices Andrew Phang, Judith Prakash, Belinda Ang and Chao Hick Tin.

&gt; Nagaenthran has also asked the court to exercise its power to have him assessed by psychiatrists.

&gt; Nagaenthran was arrested in 2009 with heroin strapped to his thigh.

&gt; He was convicted of trafficking 42.72g of heroin in 2010 and given the death penalty, which was then mandatory.

&gt; His appeals against his conviction and sentence were dismissed in 2011.

&gt; In 2015, he applied to be resentenced to life imprisonment after the law was changed to allow the alternative sentence.

&gt; The High Court upheld his death sentence in 2017 after considering expert evidence from four psychiatric and psychological experts.

&gt; Last year, Nagaenthran made an eleventh-hour attempt to challenge his impending execution on Nov 10, on the basis that he was suffering from mental disabilities.

&gt; His bid was dismissed by the High Court and he appealed.

&gt; On the day of his appeal on Nov 9, he tested positive for Covid-19. He was granted a stay of execution and the hearing was adjourned.

&gt; SINGAPORE: A foreign worker who was sentenced to death in December for murdering his girlfriend in a Geylang hotel turned to the Court of Appeal on Tuesday (Oct 12), seeking to overturn his conviction.

&gt; Bangladeshi Ahmed Salim, 31, was convicted of killing an Indonesian maid after a tryst at the Golden Dragon Hotel on Dec 30, 2018.

&gt; Ahmed was betrothed to another woman at the time of the offence. He strangled 34-year-old Nurhidayati Wartono Surata with a towel after she refused to leave another man for him, before tying a rope around her neck in several knots and twisting her head forcefully.

&gt; She died of strangulation and a cervical spine injury, and her body was found by a hotel receptionist.

&gt; A High Court judge had found that Ahmed's actions before, during and after the killing demonstrated ""premeditation, cogent planning and methodical execution"".

&gt; On Tuesday, Ahmed's lawyers, led by Mr Eugene Thuraisingam, sought to have the conviction overturned and the murder charge downgraded to one without a mandatory death sentence.

&gt; Mr Thuraisingam, along with lawyers Chooi Jing Yen and Hamza Malik, said their case was that Ahmed took the life of the victim as he was ""tormented by the idea that the woman he loved was seeing another man and leaving him for good"".

&gt; THE DEFENCE'S ARGUMENT

&gt; The lawyers argued that Ahmed was driven in his actions by his adjustment disorder. It was directly caused by his relationship problems and gave him heartache, anxiety, jealousy and depression, making him ""prone to impulsivity and violence"", they said.

&gt; On the night of the murder, the victim was quarrelling with Ahmed about her new relationship and uttered humiliating words to him, the lawyers argued.

&gt; At trial, Ahmed had claimed that the victim told him: ""He is better than you, he is better than you in the hotel, he is better in bed, he is better financially. If you don't believe, next week I will go with him, we'll make a video and show you.""

&gt; However, the trial judge found that she did not say that, and that Ahmed had not mentioned such words in his multiple interviews with the police or with the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) psychiatrist.

&gt; Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon, who heard the appeal along with Justices Andrew Phang and Chao Hick Tin, told Mr Thuraisingam that the controversy was not whether Ahmed had adjustment disorder, but what effect this disorder had on Ahmed.

&gt; Justice Phang asked the defence what the evidence was showing that this impairment entitled Ahmed to the defence of diminished responsibility. For a defence of diminished responsibility to stand, the accused must be suffering from a specific abnormality of mind that substantially impaired his mental responsibility for causing the death.

&gt; Justice Phang pointed out that if, as the trial judge found, the murder was premeditated, then the defence's whole argument ""is based on sand"" and collapses.

&gt; Chief Justice Menon agreed and told the defence that ""it's going to be very hard for you to dislodge the judge's finding that this was a premeditated plan"".

&gt; ""Your client wanted an outcome, and if he didn't get that outcome, he was already contemplating how to kill the victim,"" he said.

&gt; Justice Phang pointed to how the killing was carried out - with two strangulations and the deliberate tying of a rope ""to ensure that the victim died"".

&gt; He added that jealousy ""cannot be an excuse"".

&gt; The three-judge panel reserved their judgment and will issue their verdict at a later date.

&gt; SINGAPORE: A man who escaped the gallows in 1994 after killing a Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) officer has been sentenced to death for possessing drugs for trafficking.

&gt; In grounds released on Monday (Nov 2), Justice Valerie Thean said she gave the mandatory death sentence to Roshdi Abdullah Altway, 61, for a single charge of possessing a controlled drug for trafficking.

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Roshdi was arrested on Sep 14, 2016, at the void deck of Block 209B, Compassvale Lane with S$18,000 on him. At least 78.77g of diamorphine, also known as heroin, along with various drug paraphernalia, was recovered from the room he rented at the Sengkang flat.

&gt; During the trial, Roshdi admitted possessing the heroin, but denied doing so for the purposes of trafficking. He claimed he had held the drugs for safekeeping for a person known only as Aru, intending to return them, and asked the court to amend the charge to possession of drugs.

&gt; He argued that he had given certain statements based on alleged inducement from police officers, saying that one officer had told him: ""Now Singapore has a new law. If this thing is not yours, you will not be hanged. You don't be afraid.""

&gt; As a result, Roshdi said he was induced to make his statements involuntarily to the officer and that the statements were therefore inadmissible in law.

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; However, Justice Thean said a psychiatrist who examined Roshdi found that the accused had a suspicion of CNB officers, making it unlikely for him to trust them.

&gt; This stemmed from a 10-year imprisonment sentence involving the manslaughter of a CNB officer, and a 12-year sentence for drug trafficking.

&gt; ""In light of Roshdi's history and personal circumstances, the expectation was that Roshdi would be skeptical and wary, not trusting and unquestioning,"" said the judge.

&gt; INCONSISTENCIES IN HIS EVIDENCE AT TRIAL

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Roshdi had admitted in statements to receiving, repacking and delivering drugs on multiple occasions, agreeing to help Aru to repack and distribute drugs to customers for S$100 per ""head"" of heroin.

&gt; ""Roshdi’s version at trial that he was merely safekeeping the drugs was therefore diametrically opposed to what he described in his statements,"" said Justice Thean.

&gt; ""According to him, he agreed to safekeep the drugs because Aru had offered him money and persuaded him to do so. Roshdi claimed that Aru would deliver the drugs to him for safekeeping, and that they came prepacked.""

&gt; Roshdi claimed that the S$18,000 found on him when he was arrested was for a delivery of anchovies he was expecting.

&gt; The judge found that the explanations given in Roshdi's statements were ""detailed, coherent and consistent"", while his evidence at trial ""did not withstand scrutiny"".

&gt; The inconsistencies in his evidence ""were part of a general pattern of evasiveness"", said Justice Thean.

&gt; LIES, ILLOGICAL RESPONSES

&gt; Roshdi had also admitted that about 30 per cent of his statements to the psychiatrist were lies, and that he would have lied in his statements had he not been ""induced"" to make them.

&gt; ""Roshdi’s professed willingness to lie, coupled with his illogical responses on the stand, went to issues of general credibility and were consistent with my finding that the statements, rather than his version on the stand, were reliable.""

&gt; She found that the prosecution had proven the element of possession for the purposes of trafficking beyond reasonable doubt.

&gt; Roshdi escaped the death penalty in 1994 after his conviction for murdering a CNB officer was quashed and he was given jail instead for culpable homicide committed in self-defence.

&gt; Roshdi had struck the officer with a granite mortar during a fight over money, when he thought the officer was reaching for his revolver. The blow left multiple fractures on the officer's skull, and his body was later found in Roshdi's car.

&gt; A Malaysian debt collector, who was implicated by two drug couriers as the mastermind behind a heroin transaction, was sentenced to hang yesterday.

&gt; Punithan Genasan, 37, is the first person here to be handed the death penalty via remote hearing amid the coronavirus pandemic.

&gt; He was found to be complicit in trafficking at least 28.5g of heroin by introducing the two couriers to each other in 2011 and instructing one to drive into Singapore to meet the other.

&gt; He left Singapore on the day he introduced the duo - Malaysian V. Shanmugam Veloo and Singaporean Mohd Suief Ismail - and was eventually extradited to Singapore on Jan 21, 2016, five days after he was arrested in Malaysia.

&gt; Punithan denied any connection to the pair and disputed their testimonies that he had recruited them to transport drugs, linked them up and arranged the transaction.

&gt; He called a friend and his wife as witnesses to support his claim.

&gt; But his alibi defence was rejected by High Court judge Chan Seng Onn, who pronounced the mandatory death penalty in a hearing on video-conferencing platform Zoom.

&gt; Justice Chan said the couriers had given detailed and cogent accounts of their relationships with Punithan. In contrast, Punithan was unable to explain how the couriers knew personal details about him.

&gt; The couriers were convicted in 2015. Shanmugam, then 30, was sentenced to life imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane while Suief, then 46, was sentenced to death.

&gt; Related Story Man sentenced to death for drug trafficking; his brother gets life imprisonment

&gt; During Punithan's trial, which started in January 2018, the court heard how he had recruited them separately.

&gt; On Oct 12, 2011, Punithan introduced the two at the carpark of McDonald's at West Coast Park.

&gt; On Oct 27, 2011, Punithan took possession of the car for a few hours before returning it to Shanmugam in Johor.

&gt; The next day, Shanmugam drove the car to Singapore and picked up Suief at a bus stop at Haw Par Villa. Punithan then phoned Suief and told him to deliver three of the 10 bundles of heroin that were in the car.

&gt; Punithan claimed that he never met the pair on Oct 12 as he was collecting a debt with his friend, Gobi Krishna Karuppiah.

&gt; He also claimed he could not have passed the car to Shanmugam as he was in Kedah celebrating Deepavali with his family. Justice Chan accepted that Punithan was in Singapore to collect a debt, but said there was ample time for him to meet the couriers that day.

&gt; SINGAPORE: The Court of Appeal on Friday (Nov 26) dismissed appeals by three men against their convictions for their roles in the trafficking of about 1.3kg of cannabis.

&gt; This means that Malaysian Kamalnathan Muniandy, 27, and Singaporean Chandroo Subramaniam, 52, will be sentenced to death for conspiring to traffic the Class A controlled drug.

&gt; Malaysian national Pravinash Chandran, 26, will be jailed for life and given 15 strokes of the cane for having the drugs in his possession for the purpose of trafficking.

&gt; He was found to be a mere courier of the drugs, and the prosecution had certified that he substantively assisted the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) in disrupting drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore.

&gt; BACKGROUND OF THE CASE

&gt; The trial judge had found in his decision in October 2020 that the three men had agreed to meet on Mar 5, 2016, to deliver three blocks of vegetable matter containing at least 1.34kg of cannabis to Chandroo.

&gt; Kamalnathan and Pravinash entered Singapore through Woodlands Checkpoint, and headed to Kranji MRT station. The drugs were transferred into Pravinash's haversack before they headed to Kranji Road, where they met Chandroo.

&gt; Chandroo handed money and empty plastic bags to Kamalnathan and Pravinash, before splitting up. The three men were arrested shortly after by CNB officers, and the drugs were found in Pravinash's haversack.

&gt; During the trial, all three men gave different accounts of what happened. Pravinash admitted entering Singapore that day to deliver drugs to a customer in Singapore.

&gt; He said he carried one of the three blocks of cannabis at first, while Kamalnathan carried the other two. According to him, Kamalnathan took the lead and received instructions from a ""boss"" known as Suren via his handphone.

&gt; Pravinash said it was Kamalnathan who established contact with Chandroo, took the money and plastic bags from him and suggested they regroup at a coffee shop due to police presence. Pravinash denied knowing the nature of the drugs.

&gt; Kamalnathan admitted in his police statements that he took instructions from Suren and knew Pravinash had drugs on him, as he had been paid a significant sum of 200 ringgit to take Pravinash to Singapore.

&gt; However, he said it was Pravinash who identified Chandroo. At trial, he changed his version of events to say he had entered Singapore to find a job, and that it was Pravinash who told him to take instructions from Suren.

&gt; Chandroo denied all knowledge of the drugs and trafficking. He said in an initial statement that he was on his way to Malaysia to pass S$4,000 to a friend to pay for his house.

&gt; He fortuitously met Kamalnathan and Pravinash for the first time along Kranji Road when Pravinash stopped to ask for directions to Tekka, he claimed.

&gt; Later on, at trial, Chandroo claimed he was at Kranji Road to pass money to a friend.

&gt; The Court of Appeal in their judgment on Friday found that the trial judge had neither erred in accepting Pravinash's account of events, nor in rejecting the accounts of Kamalnathan and Chandroo.

&gt; Evidence showed that Kamalnathan and Pravinash had previously delivered drugs to customers in Singapore. Pravinash said they had delivered drugs to strangers in Singapore on Mar 1, 2 and 4 in 2016, and this was corroborated by their Immigration and Checkpoints Authority records reflecting their entry into the country.

&gt; Kamalnathan's phone and toll records showed he was in constant contact with Suren after these entries into Singapore.

&gt; The Court of Appeal affirmed the convictions of all three men, and dismissed their appeals against their respective sentences, saying there was no basis to set aside the mandatory sentences.

A more lenient punishment only lowers the risk of committing a crime, obviously if it's illegal you will get punished. The idea you're bringing up is that, in general, different countries have their own ways of doing things, and in that vein I agree- if you disagree with the punishment here, commit your crime elsewhere, maybe somewhere where it isn't illegal at all (but that's another topic).

The morality argument is that the human body and existence is inviolable, which implies that corporal punishment and death sentences morally wrong. My personal opinion notwithstanding, morality is relative, and is therefore not necessarily absolute. It is up to legislative and judiciary systems of each country to ascribe a moral value to the human body, and then assign a punishment to each crime accordingly. Clearly, Singapore feels that either the human body is not as sacred as other countries consider, or that the crimes associated with corporal punishment and death sentences infringe on a social or moral value that is equally (or more) sacred. If our country decides that drugs and murder are deserving of death, then that is their stand, or at least that is the image they want to portray.

OP, I don't believe that morality argument is not reasonable, and even you have agreed that morality is fluid. I respect the opinion that these punishments are morally reprehensible because of moral relativism, so I think we all should just agree to disagree. Them? They should too, but discussion is always okay.

There are other arguments against corporal punishment, such as increased aggression in society, psychological scars, etc., but I believe most people are questioning the morality of the punishment, especially since the word ""inhumane"" is thrown around a lot.

&gt; SINGAPORE: A man who was sentenced to death via Zoom for trafficking diamorphine or pure heroin has been acquitted of the charge, after the Court of Appeal considered new evidence that showed the prosecution did not prove its case.

&gt; In a judgment released on Monday (Oct 31), the court acquitted Malaysian Punithan Genasan of one count of trafficking in 28.5g of diamorphine at West Coast McDonald's car park in October 2011 by introducing two couriers to each other.

&gt; Punithan had been sentenced to death in May 2020, the first to be given the penalty during the COVID-19 pandemic.

&gt; The couriers, Malaysian V Shanmugam Veloo and Singaporean Mohd Suief Ismail, had been nabbed by Central Narcotics Bureau officers on Oct 28, 2011, after Suief got into Shanmugam's car. Granular substances containing at least 28.5g of diamorphine were later found among their possessions.

&gt; Punithan was implicated during investigations into the two men's cases, with Shanmugam pointing to Punithan as the mastermind who coordinated the drug transaction.

&gt; It was not disputed that the transaction in relation to the two couriers took place. Shanmugam was sentenced to life imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane, while Suief was sentenced to death.

&gt; However, the central question in the appeal was whether there was a meeting between the duo and Punithan on Oct 12, 2011, because that was the link alleged between Punithan and the drug transaction that took place later on Oct 28, 2011.

&gt; The prosecution had to prove beyond reasonable doubt that this meeting to introduce the couriers to each other did take place, in order to prove Punithan's charge, said the court.

&gt; Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon and Justices Andrew Phang and Tay Yong Kwang said there were discrepancies in the evidence about the date and time of day about this supposed meeting at trial.

&gt; Punithan was represented by a team of lawyers from K&amp;L Gates Straits Law, led by Senior Counsel Narayanan Sreenivasan. His lawyers introduced fresh evidence including investigation statements from Shanmugam and Suief, the Singtel call trace report for Suief's phone and the ICA travel movement records for Shanmugam, as well as his foster mother and foster daughter.

&gt; According to Suief's statement in late October 2011, the meeting took place at about ""5 plus in the evening"". Shanmugam, however, claimed on Oct 31, 2011 that the meeting took place between 1pm and 3pm.

&gt; In both their statements and oral testimony, neither of the men alluded to the possibility that the meeting could have been in the morning, said Justice Tay, who delivered the verdict on behalf of the three-judge panel.

&gt; However, according to the ICA travel movement records, the only time the meeting could have taken place was in the early part of the morning of Oct 12, 2011, said the judge.

&gt; ""Accordingly, there remained a lingering reasonable doubt as to the time of the alleged introductory meeting and therefore a reasonable doubt about whether the couriers were indeed testifying about the meeting of 12 October 2011,"" said Judge Tay.

&gt; He added that the meeting was a ""pivotal element"" in the charge against Punithan.

&gt; Citing the ""unique circumstances of this case"", he said the charge was not proven beyond reasonable doubt as there was a reasonable doubt whether the meeting took place in the morning of Oct 12, 2011.

&gt; Justice Tay stressed that decision in this appeal was focused on the meeting and had no effect whatsoever on the conviction and appeals of the couriers, who were found to be in possession of the drugs and in the process of distributing them.

&gt; Singapore has sentenced another Malaysian to death, this time a 39-year-old man, for trafficking heroin.

&gt; Munusamy Ramarmurth, a cleaning supervisor was caught with a bag containing drugs in his motorcycle parked along Harbourfront Avenue.

&gt; He was convicted by the High Court on Nov. 10 of being in possession of 6.3kg of a granular substance, The Straits Times reported.

&gt; Analysis revealed 57.54g of heroin was in the substance.

&gt; In Singapore, the death penalty applies if the amount of heroin trafficked is more than 15g.

&gt; 42-page ruling

&gt; Justice Audrey Lim penned a 42-page written judgement to explain her decision to convict Munusamy and pass the mandatory death penalty on him.

&gt; She said she was not convinced about his argument that he thought the bag contained stolen mobile phones, ST reported.

&gt; She also disbelieved Munusamy's account that he allowed an acquaintance to temporarily store a bag in the rear box of his motorcycle for another man to collect it later.

&gt; About the case

&gt; Munusamy has worked in Singapore for 14 years.

&gt; He was arrested on Jan. 26, 2018, in the afternoon in the cleaners' room at Harbourfront Centre Tower 2 and escorted to his vehicle.

&gt; A red plastic bag was found in the rear box of his motorcycle parked at the open-air carpark at Keppel Bay Tower.

&gt; It contained bundles of drugs.

&gt; What accused claimed

&gt; Munusamy said during trial he had allowed another Malaysian, named Saravanan, to put the bag in the box for safekeeping.

&gt; Saravanan told him someone called ""Boy"" would collect it, the accused claimed, saying that he thought the bag contained stolen mobile phones.

&gt; This was because Saravanan and Boy had asked Munusamy to help store some stolen phones in the box back in July 2017.

&gt; Munusamy said Saravanan told him the items in the bag were ""panas"", a term which meant ""stolen items"", but can also refer to ""illegal drugs"".

&gt; Judge not convinced

&gt; Justice Lim concluded that Munusamy's story on the stand was a fabrication, calling it an ""afterthought which emerged only at the trial"".

&gt; In his statements to Central Narcotics Bureau, the judge noted, Munusamy made no mention of the alleged July 2017 incident or that the bag would be collected by someone.

&gt; She noted that the accused knew Saravanan was involved in drug activities, but did not check the contents of the bag.

&gt; Under Singapore law, it is up to the discretion of the court whether to impose the death penalty if a drug courier had substantively assisted CNB in disrupting drug activities and the prosecution certifies that to have been the case

&gt; Justice Lim said in her written judgement: ""At the conclusion of the trial, I found that the Prosecution had proved beyond a reasonable doubt the charge, and I convicted Munusamy on the charge.""

&gt; ""I found that Munusamy’s role in the offence was restricted to that of a courier.""

&gt; ""As the prosecution did not issue him with a certificate of substantive assistance... I passed the mandatory death sentence on him.""

&gt; Trial controversy

&gt; But this trial was not conducted without controversy.

&gt; In her judgement, Justice Lim also reprimanded investigating officer Derek Wong for prompting a witness during the trial.

&gt; Wong had signalled to a witness, Mohammad Nasrulhaq, a police officer who was on the stand on two occasions.

&gt; On the first occasion, he picked up a field diary and showed it to Nasrulhaq when the latter was asked if the handover of the bag was recorded.

&gt; The second time was when Wong mouthed the word “diamorphine” when Nasrulhaq was asked what the term “heroin” referred to.

&gt; She said such conduct was “inappropriate and unacceptable”.

&gt; However, Lim noted that Wong’s conduct had not prejudiced Munusamy’s case.

&gt; The judge has directed the public prosecutor to raise the matter to the CNB to take appropriate measures.

Yea, being harsh on drugs is the reason why we don't have much of a drug problem, but the mandatory death sentence is pretty insane. If someone brings kilograms of the stuff, then yeah, that is clear intent to distribute. But even at such tiny quantities, we actually have the state execute those found guilty in our name.

I'll be frank with my opinion; I'm not actually fully against the death penalty. I totally get why many are; it's for the last sentence of my previous paragraph; the state is literally killing another human being ""for us"". That doesn't sit well with many, and honestly, that should be the way. But I hold a special kind of disdain and hatred for certain criminals; those that abuse children, commit murder, serial rapists, etc. I'm cold towards said ""people"", and for them, I honestly wouldn't mind the state doing what they do.

But because there are people who are against it, and let's be real, it isn't a great thing to be supportive of, we should honestly either abolish it, or make the standards of receiving the death penalty much harder. Because as it is, we're executing people too often for such crimes. It's even worse when you consider the fact that the couriers/mules might not be doing what they do out of choice.

It's not exactly great when society is living peacefully on the corpses of many.

my contrary viewpoint is, if he was conscious of the bag containing heroin, he would have prepared in advance an excuse if he was caught. fact that judge thinks it was an afterthought makes he consider he truly didn't know. But that is exactly what I would expect the criminal behind this operation to do, use an unknowing person to smuggle the drugs in. this is because a person who thinks he's doing something so illegal would probably look very nervous or even think of backing out last minute.

fella was unfortunately used by the real criminals and sadly has to pay the price for his naivety or trusting the wrong people.  I highly doubt 50g less of heroin into SG dents how much comes in. The smuggling is likely is a few large hauls, less likely is hundreds of 50g trips.

why are we focused on killing such small fry? it's not as if we catch a hundred of 50g couriers each week/month.

we should do more conscious education of people to warn them of such scams so that do not mistakenly become drug couriers. it's far worse than those phone/sms bank scams.

&gt; SINGAPORE: Prosecutors are appealing for a couple, who caused the death of their 5-year-old son by repeatedly scalding him with hot water, to be given life sentences, overturning the previous jail terms imposed on husband and wife.

&gt; In July last year, Ridzuan Mega Abdul Rahman and his wife Azlin Arujunah had each been sentenced to 27 years' jail for voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous means.

&gt; Rizuan was also sentenced to 24 strokes of the cane, while Azlin was given an additional 12 months in prison in lieu of caning.

&gt; In 2016, between Oct 15 and 22, the boy was subjected to four incidents of scalding, committed by his parents individually as well as together.

&gt; On Oct 22 that year, Azlin woke up Ridzuan and asked him to “deal with” their son, who did not want to remove his shorts for a shower.

&gt; The boy, who was in a weakened state from previous scaldings, was hit with a broom by his father, who then threw cups of hot water at him.

&gt; The 5-year-old crouched down as hot water was poured over his body in the toilet, where he eventually fell forward and stopped moving.

&gt; He was taken to hospital after more than six hours as his parents were afraid of getting arrested. The boy succumbed to his injuries and was pronounced dead the next morning.

&gt; SINGAPORE - A 39-year-old Malaysian cleaning supervisor who was caught with a bag of drugs in his motorcycle parked along Harbourfront Avenue has been sentenced to death for trafficking.

&gt; Munusamy Ramarmurth was convicted by the High Court last Wednesday (Nov 10) of being in possession of 6.3kg of a granular substance, which was found to contain 57.54g of heroin after analysis. The law provides for the death penalty if the amount of heroin trafficked is more than 15g.

&gt; In written grounds issued on Monday (Nov 15) to explain her decision to convict Munusamy, Justice Audrey Lim said she disbelieved his contention that he thought the bag contained stolen mobile phones.

&gt; The judge also rejected his claim that he had allowed a compatriot to store the bag temporarily in the rear box of his motorcycle so that another man could collect it later.

&gt; In her 42-page grounds, Justice Lim also rapped investigating officer (IO) Derek Wong for prompting a witness on the stand during the trial - conduct that the judge said was ""inappropriate and unacceptable"".

&gt; ""Attempting to prompt a witness who is testifying, even on a point which may turn out to be immaterial or inconsequential, is improper and unbefitting of an enforcement officer,"" she said.

&gt; The IO had signalled to Sergeant Mohammad Nasrulhaq on two occasions.

&gt; He picked up a field diary and showed it to Sgt Nasrulhaq when the latter was being asked about whether the handover of a duffel bag was recorded.

&gt; He also mouthed the word ""diamorphine"" when Sgt Nasrulhaq was asked by the court what the term ""heroin"" refers to.

&gt; The judge said that while the IO's conduct did not prejudice Munusamy's case, the same might not be said in other instances.

&gt; Justice Lim said she had directed the Public Prosecutor to raise the matter to the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) to take appropriate measures, and to ensure that officers who are involved in investigations are properly briefed and made aware of the boundaries of their conduct in relation to cases pending in court.

&gt; Munusamy, who has worked in Singapore for 14 years, was arrested on the afternoon of Jan 26, 2018, in the cleaners' room at Harbourfront Centre Tower 2.

&gt; He was then escorted to his motorcycle parked at the open-air carpark at Keppel Bay Tower. A red plastic bag, containing bundles of drugs, was found in the rear box of his bike.

&gt; During his trial, Munusamy said he had allowed a Malaysian named Saravanan to store the bag temporarily in the box. He said Saravanan told him someone known as ""Boy"" would collect it.

&gt; Munusamy claimed that he thought the bag contained stolen mobile phones because in July 2017, Saravanan and Boy had asked him to help store some stolen phones in the box.

&gt; He said Saravanan told him the items in the bag were ""panas"".

&gt; Munusamy said the term meant ""stolen item"" although his lawyer, Mr Mahadevan Lukshumayeh, did not dispute that it could also refer to illegal drugs.

&gt; Justice Lim concluded that Munusamy's story was made up.

&gt; ""I found his claim that he thought the red bag contained handphones or stolen handphones was an afterthought which emerged only at the trial,"" said the judge.

&gt; She noted that in his statements to CNB, Munusamy made no mention of the alleged July 2017 incident or that the bag would be collected by someone later.

&gt; On the contrary, the judge found, Munusamy knew what was in the bag.

&gt; She noted that he knew Saravanan was involved in drug activities, yet he did not check the contents of the bag.

&gt; Under the law, the court has the discretion not to impose the death penalty if the prosecution certifies that a drug courier had substantively assisted CNB in disrupting drug activities.

&gt; ""As the prosecution did not issue him with a certificate of substantive assistance... I passed the mandatory death sentence on him,"" said Justice Lim.

&gt; SINGAPORE: A man who was sentenced to death for murdering his girlfriend in a Geylang hotel had his appeal against conviction dismissed on Wednesday (Jan 19).

&gt; The Court of Appeal found that the defence had not established the partial defence of diminished responsibility, nor rebutted any elements of the murder charge.

&gt; Bangladeshi Ahmed Salim, 33, was sentenced to death in December 2020 for killing Indonesian national Nurhidayati Wartono Surata, 34, after a tryst at the Golden Dragon Hotel on Dec 30, 2018.

&gt; He was found guilty of strangling her with a towel after she refused to leave another man for him. He also tied a rope around her neck in several knots and twisted her head forcefully, causing her to die of strangulation and a cervical spine injury.

&gt; Ahmed, who was betrothed to another woman at the time of the offence, argued that he was tormented by the idea that the woman he loved was seeing another man and leaving him.

&gt; However, the trial judge found that Ahmed's actions before, during and after the killing showed ""premeditation, cogent planning and methodical execution"".

&gt; Ahmed, who is defended by Mr Eugene Thuraisingam, Mr Chooi Jing Yen and Mr Hamza Malik, appealed against the murder conviction. The lawyers asked for the charge to be downgraded to one without a mandatory death sentence, saying he was driven by his adjustment disorder that was directly caused by his relationship problems.

&gt; At trial, Ahmed claimed that the victim had told him on the night of the murder that her new lover was ""better than you in the hotel"", ""better in bed"" and better financially.

&gt; In their judgment on Wednesday, Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon and Justices Andrew Phang and Chao Hick Tin dismissed the defence's argument.

&gt; They agreed with the trial judge that Ahmed's preparatory steps and the manner in which he executed his plan showed beyond a reasonable doubt that he intended to kill the victim.

&gt; They also agreed that the victim did not utter the humiliating words Ahmed alleged she had. The words were not in Ahmed's police statements and there was no explanation for why he had not told the police nor the psychiatrist who examined him.

&gt; The judges found that Ahmed's adjustment disorder did not substantially impair his mental responsibility for the murder. This was because he was ""rational, had self-control and was fully able to comprehend events at the critical moment when he finally decided to kill (the victim)"".

&gt; He also admitted in his statements that he decided to kill her because he was afraid she would call the police.

&gt; He told the psychiatrist: ""I ... slapped her. Then I thought if I let her go now, she would call police so I thought, I might as well kill her.""

&gt; These statements showed that Ahmed was able to exercise self-control and rational thought right up to the time of the killing, the court found.

&gt; SINGAPORE: A Bangladeshi worker was sentenced to death on Monday (Dec 14) for murdering his domestic helper girlfriend in a Geylang hotel two years ago.

&gt; Ahmed Salim, 31, was convicted of killing his girlfriend of six years after a tryst in the Golden Dragon Hotel on Dec 30, 2018, when she refused to leave another man for him.

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Ahmed, who was betrothed to another woman at the time, first strangled 34-year-old Indonesian national Nurhidayati Wartono Surata with a towel. He then tied a rope around her neck in several knots and twisted her head forcefully.

&gt; He stole her valuables and left her body to be found by a receptionist later that night. An autopsy found the cause of death to be strangulation and a cervical spine injury.

&gt; Judicial Commissioner Mavis Chionh found that his actions before, during and after the killing ""demonstrated premeditation, cogent planning and methodical execution"".

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; She rejected Ahmed's partial defence of grave and sudden provocation – that the victim had humiliated him by saying: ""He is better than you, he is better than you in the hotel, he is better in bed, he is better financially. If you don't believe, next week I will go with him, we’ll make a video and show you.""

&gt; The judge found that the victim had said no such humiliating words. Ahmed had not mentioned these words in his multiple police statements and in his interviews with the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) psychiatrist.

&gt; The allegations surfaced only one-and-a-half years after the incident, when Ahmed was providing his account of events to the defence psychiatrist.

&gt; ""I find his explanations for his failure to mention the humiliating words in the police statements and to (the IMH psychiatrist) to be far-fetched,"" said the judge. ""I agree with the prosecution that the accused's story of the humiliating words was precisely that – a story.""

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Even if the victim had said such words, the judge said that this was a premeditated killing, with Ahmed keeping a rope in his pants and taking it with him to the hotel and clearing his bank account beforehand.

&gt; ""On the totality of the evidence ... I find that the accused had decided even before Dec 30, 2018, that he would kill the deceased so long as she refused to leave her new boyfriend and to get back together with him,"" said Judicial Commissioner Chionh.

&gt; Ahmed had also made several admissions in his police statements that showed his premeditated plan to kill the victim.

&gt; In his testimony at trial, led by defence lawyers Eugene Thuraisingam, Chooi Jing Yen and Hamzah Malik, Ahmed said he considered the victim to be his wife, even though they were not married.

&gt; He was diagnosed with adjustment disorder at the time of the offence, but no contributory link was found between this disorder and the crime.

&gt; SINGAPORE - A drug syndicate was busted in a two-day sting operation by the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB), which netted more than 8kg of drugs worth close to $343,000 in street value.

&gt; Officers also arrested a 42-year-old Singaporean man, who put up a violent struggle, for suspected drug offences during the operation, CNB said on Thursday.

&gt; The drugs seized over Tuesday and Wednesday included over 5kg of cannabis, 659g of Ice or crystal methamphetamine, 442g of ketamine, 252g of Ecstasy tablets and 145 Erimin-5 tablets, .

&gt; CNB officers also found 17 bottles of liquid suspected to contain gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) and 535g of tampered sachets of beverage mix believed to contain controlled drugs.

&gt; CNB said that the amount of cannabis seized can feed the addictions of about 720 abusers for a week while the amount of Ice found can feed the addiction of some 380 abusers for the same period.

&gt; The 42-year-old man was arrested in Geylang Road on Tuesday evening. No further details were provided on other members of the syndicate.

&gt; A total of 134g of Ice, over 1.6kg of cannabis, 77g of ketamine, 54g of Ecstasy tablets and 50 Erimin-5 tablets were recovered from the man.

&gt; He was then taken to his hideout - a residential unit nearby - where 525g of Ice, over 3.4kg of cannabis, 365g of ketamine, 198g of Ecstasy tablets, 95 Erimin-5 tablets and the 17 bottles of liquid as well as 136g of tampered sachets of beverage mix were seized.

&gt; The drug operation continued on Wednesday, where another 399g of tampered sachets of beverage mix believed to contain controlled drugs were seized from a unit in an industrial building in Eunos Avenue 3. The unit was suspected to be operating as a drug store.

&gt; Superintendent Stanley Seah, deputy director of CNB's intelligence division, said that the bureau will continue to take decisive and firm action against drug syndicates and traffickers seeking to bring harm to the community and profit off the misery of abusers' family and loved ones.

&gt; ""Drugs have no place in our society, and my officers will stop at nothing to bring those involved in this case to justice.""

&gt; Those found guilty of trafficking more than 500g of cannabis may face the death penalty.

When you break a SG law, especially a serious one, you must be prepared to pay the price. Coming into Singapore, you are told not to bring drugs; penalty being death. 

It simple doesn't matter what that severe penalty is for; when you enter a country, you abide by its laws, whether you agree with them or not. You don't selectively choose which to ignore and which to follow.

Personally I am not for death penalty except in violent crimes. The problem is how you define ""violent crime"". The drug trade should fall under violent crime because it absolutely does create entire ecosystem of violence, death, and destruction.

You could argue, maybe, for differentiation between hard drugs and softer drugs, and sentence on that; with more leniency on softer drugs; but saying drug crimes aren't violent is not truthful.

Might I also add: what about alcohol? Tobacco? Those are certainly still legal? What separates those drugs from say Marijuana? I’ve seen papers which argue marijuana use is less detrimental than tobacco, so why the delay in a review of drug laws?!

I am writing this not to change your mind but I feel that everyone should have all information in order to make a judgement. Do your own research too and if after all that you still feel the same way at the very least you did so educated on the subject. 

Law student here who worked at a legal clinic surrounding this subject, honestly going into it I believed that the death penalty in Singapore was a pragmatic and logical system that unlike other countries, was applied fairly. My opinion on the matter has changed but I am still in support of the death penalty for only the most serious of crimes (as stated by the UN)

[https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/safeguards-guaranteeing-protection-rights-those-facing-death](https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/safeguards-guaranteeing-protection-rights-those-facing-death)

While not binding, they give fair guidelines for applying the death penalty. Singapore refuses to work with the UN on this matter. I agree that it is fair for Singapore to take this stance as the circumstances of other countries are different to ours. but still they should pay attention to how the world is moving away from state sanctioned murder.

Here are some myths that people often believe are true when they aren’t. Also some facts

1. Death row is cheaper than life imprisonment.

This has been found false. Death row inmates can be on death row for decades, inbetween that constant legal battles will be put forward (when your life is on the line you’ll fire all your guns). If it was life imprisonment it’s unlikely there would be that much of a fight for survival.

[https://www.wbir.com/amp/article/news/local/death-penalty-vs-life-in-prison-the-costs/51-581820292](https://www.wbir.com/amp/article/news/local/death-penalty-vs-life-in-prison-the-costs/51-581820292)

Making it cheaper by speeding up the process will mean a higher chance of killing an innocent man. In America 4.1% of death row inmates were exonerated after being killed. It is likely plenty of cases has had innocent people executed.

[https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/policy-issues/innocence/executed-but-possibly-innocent](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/policy-issues/innocence/executed-but-possibly-innocent)

[https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1306417111](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1306417111)

2. The death penalty is widely accepted by Singapore society and thus we should preserve it as it is part of our identity of “dont fuck around in our country”

Our minister of law stated that over 80% of singaporeans support the death penalty

[https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/more-than-80-of-sporeans-surveyed-believe-death-penalty-has-deterred-offenders-shanmugam](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/more-than-80-of-sporeans-surveyed-believe-death-penalty-has-deterred-offenders-shanmugam)

HOWEVER a study done by NUS shows that when those surveyed were given real life case studies, a significant number of people were not comfortable with the death penalty and the approval for it significantly dropped.

[https://law.nus.edu.sg/publications/public-opinion-on-the-death-penalty-in-singapore-survey-findings/](https://law.nus.edu.sg/publications/public-opinion-on-the-death-penalty-in-singapore-survey-findings/)

It’s an interesting read, death penalty support is high for seniors but low for the younger crowd. It also shows that many believe that moral education is more effective than the death penalty (page 19). Further, the study showed that people would be agreeable to reducing life imprisonment forever to life imprisonment with the chance of parole.

3. The death penalty helps deter drug smugglers from coming to Singapore (arguably the strongest argument that can be made)

Do you know what drug mules are? They aren’t criminal masterminds, they are poor desperate people who see this as their only choice. I do not agree with their choice to spread drugs to Singapore but I also do not agree that they should be sentenced to death. There will always be uneducated poor people willing to make a quick buck to survive. One of them even had an IQ of 69. Enough to be considered a disability as stated by psychiatrists who examine him.

I do however agree there may be some merits to the death penalty, studies have shown that overseas couriers are less willing to traffic amounts that attract the death penalty thus less drugs come into Singapore.

Playing devil's advocate here, if the man is pardoned from the death sentence, does it not further encourage criminals to manipulate the mentally disabled to serve their crimes?

On the other hand, sentencing one unfortunate man to death isn't going to deter the manipulators from doing something similar again either, so what would this execution achieve at the expense of a human life (which could possibly be reformed)?

Nonetheless, I believe this is a controversial topic on top of the already controversial topic of death sentences, so my opinion is that the execution be delayed and further discussions be had (as what I've read from [this TODAY article](https://www.todayonline.com/apex-court-dismisses-appeals-malaysian-man-death-row-9-years-importing-drugs) does seem like more investigation could be done).",SingaporeRaw,86,t1_hims25o

Many years ago, before Dr. Mahathir was the Prime Minister (PM) of Malaysia (the first time) he wrote a book, The Malay Dilemma.

He highlighted many problems of the “brown race”, i.e. the indigenous Malay Bumiputera of Malaysia, and called to attention numerous times, their inherent laziness, low intelligence and lack of drive, initiative and spirit.

That’s a direct paraphrase.

He added that the problem was further exacerbated by many standing policies at the time, that further encouraged them to stagnate, by giving them welfare handouts. Thus, there was little incentive to innovate, improve and work hard.
He drew many stark comparisons between the Chinese-Malaysians and
Indian-Malaysians versus the Bumiputeras of Malaysia, and highlighted that non-Bumiputera ethnic groups without handouts, always seemed to perform better at academics and in life than the average Bumi.",askSingapore,3,t1_ik7gp8z

SINGAPORE: A hundred suspected drug offenders were arrested and about 8kg of controlled drugs worth more than S$835,000 were seized in a five-day drug bust, the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) said on Friday (Jan 21).

The haul comprises 5,640g of heroin, 1,744g of Ice, 1,380g of cannabis, more than 3,000 ecstasy tablets, 5g of new psychoactive substances (NPS),  24 lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) stamps, 654 Erimin-5 tablets and three bottles of methadone.

&gt; The Court of Appeal on Jul. 21 dismissed the last-minute appeal made by death row inmate, Nazeri bin Lajim, for a stay of execution.

&gt; He was hanged at 6am on Jul. 22.

&gt; There will be funeral prayers for Nazeri, followed by Friday prayers, today at Masjid Assyakirin in Taman Jurong, around 10am.

&gt; 

&gt; Then, Nazeri will be taken to the Muslim cemetery at Masjid Al-Firdaus, 11 Jalan Abadat (off Old Choa Chu Kang road). pic.twitter.com/lQOfnLaInF — Kokila Annamalai (@Kokilaparvathi) July 22, 2022

&gt; Appeared in court on Jul. 21

&gt; The 64-year-old Singaporean had filed his application to the Court of Appeal and appeared in court via video link.

&gt; He was bald, in a white top, and and wore round spectacles with a thick black frame.

&gt; He was unrepresented and spoke in Malay when he made his case through a court interpreter.

&gt; Justice Andrew Phang Boon Leong, Justice Tay Yong Kwang and Justice Belinda Ang presided over the hearing.

&gt; Activists, Kirsten Han, Jolovan Wham and Kokila Annamalai, attended the hearing alongside a few members of the public.

&gt; The death row inmate's family members were not in the courtroom.

&gt; Pleaded for stay of execution and more time

&gt; Nazeri pleaded for the judges to stay his execution and said he would need some time to seek legal counsel as his former legal counsel M Ravi is currently not practising law.

&gt; Nazeri added that he had a ""big family"" and some of his 10 siblings have yet to visit him, and there were some who were out of town.

&gt; He told the judges to exercise their ""honest compassion"" in granting him his appeal, adding that a stay of execution by ""one to two weeks"" would provide him with a ""sense of relief"".

&gt; Court dismissed application

&gt; The court stood down for nearly two hours to deliberate before Judge Phang delivered the Court of Appeal decision's to dismiss Nazeri's application.

&gt; Judge Phang noted that Nazeri filed his original application three days ago on Jul. 19, after he had been notified of his execution date, and was time-barred, which meant it was submitted past the acceptable window period.

&gt; Saying that there is no reason why the application could not have been filed earlier, Justice Phang found that it was ""clearly an abuse of process"" to ""frustrate"" Nazeri's execution from being carried out on the its Jul. 22 scheduled date.

&gt; Justice Phang said the court would consider the appellants' attempts to seek legal counsel, if they were reasonable, but stressed that Nazeri's appeals were ""entirely devoid of factual basis"".

&gt; ""Legal assistance would not give factual substratum to a case which has none to begin with.""

&gt; Justice Phang also said Nazeri has been afforded due process in a fair manner in accordance with the law, adding: ""There must come a point in time that the appellant accepts the consequences of his actions.""

&gt; After the judgement was delivered, Nazeri pleaded to the judges through his interpreter, saying: ""Why can't I even be given a stay of one to two weeks?""

&gt; He begged for their compassion and said: ""Please exercise some sympathy on me, I know that I am an elderly person. I know I have to die.""

&gt; Justice Phang responded and said that the Court of Appeal's decision was made in accordance with the law.

&gt; ""I am afraid that there’s nothing that we can do, the decision is final.""

&gt; Found in possession of 35.41g of diamorphine

&gt; Nazeri was found in possession of two bundles of drugs containing not less than 35.41g of diamorphine on Apr. 13, 2012, according to court documents.

&gt; The court made an amendment to the amount of diamorphine, or heroin, during Nazeri's conviction.

&gt; The amount of diamorphine was reduced from 35.41g to 33.39g as Nazeri claimed that he intended to keep some of the drugs for his own personal consumption, according to court documents.

&gt; Scheduled to be hanged on Jul. 22

&gt; He was convicted of trafficking not less than 33.39g of diamorphine in 2017 and sentenced to death on Sep. 21 in the same year.

&gt; He made appeals to the court in July 2018 and April 2021, both of which were dismissed by the Court of Appeal.

&gt; At least two pleas for clemency for Nazeri has been submitted, and the most recent one was delivered by his younger sister, Nazira bin Lajim, to the Istana.

&gt; This was rejected on May 6, 2022.

&gt; Nazeri's family was notified on Jul. 15 that his execution had been scheduled, according to lawyer M Ravi and social activist Kirsten Han.

&gt; Nazeri bin Lajim is the fifth person to be hanged in Singapore in 2022.

&gt; A Singaporean drug trafficker was hanged on Wednesday in the city-state's first execution since 2019, campaigners said, despite appeals for clemency from the United Nations and rights groups.

&gt; It was the first in what activists fear is a looming wave of executions and came just a day after a mentally disabled Malaysian man lost his final death sentence appeal.

&gt; Abdul Kahar Othman, sentenced to death in 2015, was executed early Wednesday, according to a leading Singaporean campaigner against capital punishment.

&gt; ""Rest in peace,"" tweeted the activist Kirsten Han.

&gt; ""We should all be ashamed of what the state did in our names today.""

&gt; A member of a support group for people with relatives on death row in Singapore, speaking anonymously, confirmed to AFP the execution had taken place.

&gt; She said she was waiting for the body to arrive at a Muslim cemetery. Abdul Kahar was a member of the city-state's Muslim minority.

&gt; Singaporean authorities did not respond to requests for confirmation.

&gt; In 2019, the last year that Singapore carried out executions, four people were hanged, according to the city-state's prison service.

&gt; The prosperous but socially conservative country has some of the world's toughest drugs laws but has faced mounting calls from rights groups to abandon the death penalty.

&gt; Authorities insist however that capital punishment remains an effective deterrent against drug trafficking and has helped to keep Singapore one of the safest places in Asia.

&gt; According to the Transformative Justice Collective, a Singaporean group that campaigns against the death penalty, 68-year-old Abdul Kahar was convicted of trafficking heroin in 2013 and sentenced to death two years later.

&gt; He was first jailed at the age of 18 and spent the rest of his life shuttling in and out of prison on drug-related offences, according to the group.

&gt; The United Nations human rights office had on Tuesday urged authorities not to go ahead with the hanging.

&gt; ""We are concerned at the surge in execution notices this year,"" it said in a tweet.

&gt; Nagaenthran K. Dharmalingam, the mentally disabled Malaysian convicted of heroin trafficking, could be hanged in the coming days after losing his final appeal on Tuesday.

&gt; His case has attracted a storm of criticism, including from the European Union and British billionaire Richard Branson.

&gt; In addition, three other men sentenced to death for drugs offences had their appeals rejected earlier in March.

&gt; SINGAPORE - A 31-year-old Malaysian drug trafficker on death row failed in an 11th hour attempt on Wednesday (July 6) for a stay on his execution scheduled on Thursday (July 7).

&gt; The lawyer for Kalwant Singh Jogindar Singh argued before the Court of Appeal that his client had given information to the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) about a suspect who was eventually arrested.

&gt; Lawyer Too Xing Ji told the packed courtroom that the CNB does not deny that the suspect was arrested in a white Honda Integra car that Kalwant Singh had informed the bureau about.

&gt; Mr Too said there was an arguable case that Kalwant Singh had substantively assisted the CNB.

&gt; Under the law, drug couriers who are certified by the prosecution to have substantively assisted the CNB in disrupting drug trafficking activities can be sentenced to life imprisonment and caning instead of the death penalty.

&gt; The three-judge court described Mr Too's efforts as ""valiant"" but dismissed the application for a stay of execution.

&gt; Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon said the CNB has stated on oath that it did not use the information provided by Kalwant Singh.

&gt; The CNB stated that the information that led to the suspect's arrest was the result of investigations into a unrelated case.

&gt; Leaving aside the lateness of the application, Kalwant Singh bore the burden of putting forward evidence to show that the CNB had used the information he provided, said the chief justice.

&gt; After the application was dismissed, Mr Too asked the court to let Kalwant Singh's family members see him one last time.

&gt; Kalwant Singh had attended the hearing via video conference.

&gt; Mr Too also asked to be allowed to make one last phone call to his client.

&gt; Chief Justice Menon said these were matters for the Singapore Prison Service to assist and urged prosecutors to help in the arrangements.

&gt; Kalwant Singh was convicted in June 2016 of two charges involving 181.05g of heroin in total.

&gt; He was jointly tried with two others - Mohamad Yazid Md Yusof and Norasharee Gous.

&gt; However, the IQ score must be interpreted in the context of the person’s difficulties in general mental abilities. Moreover, scores on subtests can vary considerably so that the full-scale IQ score may not accurately reflect overall intellectual functioning. Therefore, clinical judgment is needed in interpreting the results of IQ tests.

&gt; SINGAPORE - The courts have held that Nagaenthran K Dharmalingam, the Malaysian scheduled to be hanged for drug trafficking, knew what he was doing when he committed the crime, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said on Friday (Nov 5).

&gt; The issue of whether Nagaenthran's mental responsibility for his actions was substantially impaired, at the time he had committed the offence, was considered by the High Court, the ministry added.

&gt; It made these points in a statement responding to further media queries on the case, which has gained international attention as human rights groups and others call for a halt to Nagaenthran's upcoming execution, citing intellectual disability.

&gt; The statement added that the High Court had assessed the evidence of psychiatrists that Nagaenthran was not intellectually disabled.

&gt; This included the evidence of a psychiatrist called by the defence, ""who agreed in court, that Nagaenthran was not intellectually disabled"".

&gt; Citing findings from the High Court and the Court of Appeal in its statement, MHA said: ""The High Court considered the facts, expert evidence from four different psychiatric/psychological experts, and further submissions by the Prosecution and the Defence. The High Court held that Nagaenthran knew what he was doing, and upheld the sentence of death.""

&gt; Nagaenthran was convicted and sentenced to death in November 2010 for importing 42.72g of heroin in 2009, when he was caught at Woodlands Checkpoint while entering Singapore from Malaysia, with the bundle of drugs strapped to his thigh. The Misuse of Drugs Act provides for the death sentence where the amount of heroin imported is more than 15g.

&gt; He appealed to the Court of Appeal against his conviction and sentence, and his appeal was dismissed in September 2011.

&gt; In 2015, he filed a resentencing application to set aside the sentence of death imposed on him, and to substitute it with life imprisonment. The High Court dismissed this application in 2017, and the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal in 2019. His petition to the President for clemency was also unsuccessful.

&gt; The case came under the spotlight late last month when the Singapore Prison Service wrote a letter to Nagaenthran's mother in Ipoh on Oct 26, informing her that the death sentence on her son would be carried out on Nov 10 and that they would facilitate extended daily visits till then, was circulated on social media.

&gt; A petition calling for him to be pardoned from the death sentence, started on Oct 29, has since garnered over 55,000 signatures. It argued that Nagaenthran should be spared from death because he had committed the offence under duress, and had been assessed to have a low IQ of 69.

&gt; On Friday, MHA said the High Court had found that Nagaenthran was able to plan and organise on simpler terms, and ""was relatively adept at living independently"".

&gt; The Court also noted that his actions relating to the offence revealed that he was ""capable of manipulation and evasion"".

&gt; For example, when he was stopped at the checkpoint, he tried to forestall a search by telling the Central Narcotics Bureau officers that he was ""working in security"", and thus appealing to the social perception of the trustworthiness of security officers.

&gt; He was also noted to be ""continuously altering his account of his education qualifications, ostensibly to reflect lower educational qualifications each time he was interviewed"", said MHA.

&gt; Further, the Court of Appeal noted that Nagaenthran knew it was unlawful for him to be transporting drugs, and attempted to conceal the bundle by strapping it to his left thigh and then wearing a large pair of trousers over it.

&gt; These actions, along with his motive to commit the crime - paying off his debts - showed a ""deliberate, purposeful and calculated decision"", and ""the working of a criminal mind, weighing the risks and countervailing benefits associated with the criminal conduct in question.""

&gt; MHA said: ""Nagaenthran considered the risks, balanced it against the reward he had hoped he would get, and decided to take the risk.""

&gt; It added that Nagaenthran was accorded full due process under the law, and was represented by legal counsel throughout the process.

&gt; MHA said the penalties, including the death penalty, for the illegal trafficking, importation or exportation of drugs are made clear at Singapore's borders, to warn traffickers and syndicates of the harsh penalties they potentially face.

&gt; It added: ""The approach Singapore has taken has resulted in it being one of the safest places in the world to live, relatively free of serious crime, and without the scourge of drug related crimes and homicides - which take thousands of lives, and destroys countless young people and families, in some countries.""

I would not go so far as to say that it is ""unlawful"". Such a commentary is woefully mistaken. On the contrary, he was sentenced in accordance with the letter of the law as MHA has pointed out. 

But as a matter of practicality (and not the law), I find it difficult to deny that someone of such a low IQ would not be easily manipulated by the ultimate profiteers seated at the top of the transaction.

Support for death penalty

1) Support for death penalty because certain crimes should be punished by death.

Nothing much to say here, people are entitled to their opinion. Although I would urge you to consider the reasons to be against the death penalty first, before coming to a conclusion.

2) Support for death penalty because this will deter criminals from perpetrating the crime.

You can look at studies on whether death penalty does deter crimes. I would just link one study here

[https://www.amnestyusa.org/a-clear-scientific-consensus-that-the-death-penalty-does-not-deter/](https://www.amnestyusa.org/a-clear-scientific-consensus-that-the-death-penalty-does-not-deter/)

Does not support death penalty

1) No process is infallible. Inevitably, innocent people will be sentence to death. 

Death is FINAL. Are you willing to risk killing innocent people. Why not change the punishment to life time imprisonment instead? If new evidence come to light later, it is not too late. Is punishing criminals so important that we risk killing innocent people? Consider this, what if YOU are the innocent one on trial with death penalty as a potential outcome. 

2) The state should not wield such power.

No matter what you think of the current judicial process, no matter what you think of the current government, are you comfortable giving the power of life and death to the state? If the state turn tyrannical, by a coup (1953 Iran) or by democratic election (1933 germany), withholding the death penalty from the state is a defence against its tyranny.

Nagaenthran is not only a very unlucky person but has been treated with extreme cruelty. The man has a tested IQ of 69 and had problems even communicating coherently with his own lawyer. Compare that with the MHA narrative that this is a hardened criminal who wants to profit and to fuck up our country. Even if he was to be jailed or executed he should be held in a specialised wing for the vulnerable, as is done in many countries. 

The article, characteristic of the ST being utter trash, also omits the important point that the apex court found Nagaenthran to be purely a courier. Recent laws have relaxed the mandatory death penalty for drug couriers. Due to the principle that new laws can’t be applied retrospectively, he would have avoided that fate if the crime had been committed a few years later.

Some people here have no perspective and frankly I’m happy to not share an opinion with such morons.  One comment favourably compared a man raping his daughter to a drug mule who was manipulated to be in this position.

t1,hjjru7x,t3_qnos8t,2021-11-06 13:37:17,LucarioMagic,"While I find it sad, capital punishment is a deterrent to drug traffickers. If we were to start making exceptions, the deterrent wouldn't be taken seriously, and most likely, others will try their luck. I can only imagine the exorbitant prices for such drugs in a country where carrying drugs result in a death sentence this may be seen as a lucrative opportunity despite the risks by those from impoverished backgrounds.

In regards to the individual's IQ influencing his ability to make logical decisions, if the individual is unable to make his own decisions, my opinion is that he ought to be restricted in freedom, because who's to say he won't be influenced to make decisions harmful to others again. This implies life imprisonment for individuals who are mentally handicapped (which means all my friends playing Mobile Legends will go live in Changi prison complex)

This leads to a choice between life imprisonment or the death sentence as the punishment for trafficking drugs in Singapore.

Unfortunately as seen in my first block of text, it is my opinion that death is the deterrent for the impoverished, not life imprisonment as it's possible that they would prefer life imprisonment as they would have guaranteed food and shelter. Whilst some Kantian ethic supporters among us are willing for their tax dollars to cover the cost of imprisoning drug traffickers for life, our country's background and culture are dominantly prudent and practical(my opinion) in policy-making. Policymakers are unlikely to favor having foreign drug traffickers as an expense unless societal norms dictate otherwise.  Take our Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Act in 2015 for example, a direct consequence of the Little India riots that happened in 2013.

&gt; A Singapore court put the execution of a Malaysian man in a drug trafficking case on hold Monday after a last-ditch legal challenge, his lawyer said, following criticism from campaigners who say he is mentally disabled.

&gt; Nagaenthran K. Dharmalingam was arrested in 2009 for carrying 43 grams -- around three tablespoons -- of heroin into the city-state, which has some of the world's toughest anti-drugs laws.

&gt; He was sentenced to death the following year and was due to be hanged on Wednesday after losing several appeals, despite supporters' claims his intellectual disability means he can't make rational decisions.

&gt; But on Monday the Singapore High Court agreed to postpone the execution pending a new appeal from his lawyers, who are arguing that the hanging would be unconstitutional.

&gt; ""Good news,"" his lawyer M. Ravi wrote on Facebook, alongside the hashtags #EndCrimeNotLife and #DivineJustice.

&gt; The case will now head to the Court of Appeal for further hearings. It was not immediately clear how long the execution would be halted.

&gt; Rights groups, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have labelled the planned execution ""despicable"" and ""cruel"", while the European Union at the weekend urged the city-state to commute the sentence.

&gt; Malaysian Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob wrote to his Singapore counterpart urging the execution to be postponed on ""humanitarian grounds"", according to reports.

&gt; If it goes ahead, it will the first hanging since 2019 in Singapore, which defends its use of capital punishment as an effective deterrent against crime despite mounting calls for its abolition.

&gt; Supporters say Nagaenthran has an IQ of 69, a level recognised as an intellectual disability, and was struggling with an alcohol problem at the time of the crime.

&gt; But Singapore's home affairs ministry has defended the decision to press ahead with the hanging, saying that legal rulings had found he ""knew what he was doing"" at the time of the offence.

But still, I would like to point out fallacies on both sides of the fence- after that I will sleep a bit more soundly and I will also check my Reddit a month from now when the dust settles

u/SirPalat mentions how ""[Data shows that there isn't a statistical significant reduction in crime due to capital punishment](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/216548.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiOx4Ph04j0AhUnmGoFHduGAEgQFnoECCYQAQ&amp;sqi=2&amp;usg=AOvVaw2CxU8orxQzQ-gg_iMrrm8m)"". Let's examine how this link is problematic:

1. Data gathered is based off statistical studies that revolve around the death penalty deterring homicide. As mentioned by other users, it is not a fair extrapolation to extend and connect homicide-capital punishment relations to drug trafficking-capital punishment relations. Studies shows that drug traffickers do not explicitly believe that they are causing deaths/social harms and the act of drug trafficking is much more detached as compared to the act of murder.
2. SirPalat does ask the very real question- what's the difference between Singapore's capital punishment system vs that of the United States? Well, everything? The US's Capital Punishment system differs from state to state. Crimes are convicted based off jury systems, making the legal system more susceptible to smooth talking lawyers and criminally unaware jury members. Are we still familiar with how OJ Simpson got off the hook with his famous glove shenanigans? Furthermore, all evidence provided by the police points to drug empires located OUTSIDE of Singapore, where every drug carrier in is either a mule or a desperate fellow in need of cash. There are no local kingpins involved in this, which means that on the criminal side of things, the background of the criminals have changed drastically.

On the other side of the fence, u/loveforlandlords mentions the MHA article. Jesus christ, any scientific article out there needs at least two peer reviews before it can be published. Now, I'm not doubting the capabilities of MHA, but I am also not going to give MHA the benefit of the doubt. MHA's evidence is biased in nature, because the death penalty is as political as it gets. With overwhelming support from Singapore's silent majority for the death penalty, regardless of how effective or uneffective it is, the death penalty is here to stay, which means that any evidence corroborating the death penalty as effective punishment will be pushed to the forefront. The studies provided by MHA are tainted as they have a vested interest in making sure they support this cause. u/SirPalat is right when he says that MHA can very well selectively publish data or present it in a way that proves their point.

No one can prove, at this moment, that capital punishment works in the case of drug trafficking specifically in Singapore. Yes, there are increasing amounts of drugs being brought into SG, but we are unable to tell the underlying factor behind the increase in demand and supply, and **one can only postulate that the death penalty may not be effective**. After all, the only punishments above the death penalty are probably Gitmo-style punishments which are truly immoral- but without removing the death penalty from Singapore's laws, how can we determine if it is correlation or causation? Removing the death penalty may cause a supply surge as more mules are willing to take the risks, while the drug import increase may be due to a demand surge. The only way I see good, actual data coming in is if China decides to release their stats on drug trafficking and capital punishment so we may actually have a correlation, but China isn't releasing any data, so we can't tell a single thing about how effective it actually is aside from whatever MHA provides.

Since we cannot prove how factually effective it is, we can only examine this properly through the moral lens. Now, u/SirPalat, I do have a question for you- the current assumption, as always, is that drugs are able to spread exponential amounts of harm and pain, and hence deserves the death penalty. You of course, believe that capital punishment is wrong, and as you mentioned: ""**And I believe the Death Penalty is so flawed it is almost comical. In the US 4% of people sentenced to death has been found innocent, I am sure that Singapore will fare much better but even one innocent death is a tragedy**"".

The question is, why is it a tragedy?

Are all convictions 100% foolproof? Statistically, we can surely say that at least one person in Singapore's prisons, throughout the entire history of time, was wrongly convicted. Does this mean that we discard the due process and the legal system in pursuit of ensuring that the one innocent man is free? Of course, my example is rhetorical, pushed to the extreme, and I believe that no one wants to see that. But thus your argument would be to reduce the death penalty to a life sentence, in pursuit of... what? An appeal to a conviction that will result in a possible overturning of the sentence?

Examining it from another POV, I believe that the legal system does not serve the one innocent man, but instead serves society on the level of the greater good. I apologize as this is purely semantics, but as a technocrat I believe that the role of the legal system acts to prevent further harm to society and to serve the society as a whole, not to ensure that no one falls through the gaps. It may seem dystopian and bleak to you, but the benefits outweigh the detriments, and in this case, the death penalty serves its purpose by being the most severe form of punishment and/or determent. If ample warnings are provided to the would-be criminals before they pursue their mistakes, is the onus not on the offender rather than the legal system? If your argument is that the small time criminals are being exploited by the kingpins, then the question would be- what, realistically, is the right way for a foreign nation to crackdown on drug trade that predominately diffuses over from another country?

Lastly, I do want to talk about some random peeps who like to cite how the death penalty is more expensive that life sentences. The oft-cited articles pertain to... you guessed it, the US of A! Where each state has different laws and the appeal process can be intricate and expensive, which are mainly legal costs and lengthy wait times. Questions for you guys: 1. Is cost the main factor in determining culpability? 2. Is it possible to extrapolate a US-based study with a very different legal system to Singapore's own legal system? If cost is truly an issue, then a reform of the legal system is in order to remove bulk and wasteful processes.",singapore,1,t1_hjtr2pg

&gt; SINGAPORE – A Malaysian drug trafficker on death row is confirmed to have COVID-19 and as such, will not be executed as scheduled on Wednesday (10 November). 

&gt; Justice Andrew Phang, who revealed Nagaenthran K Dharmalingam's infection in the Court of Appeal on Tuesday, ordered the stay of execution in the case of the 33-year-old Malaysian until further notice and ordered the hearing to be adjourned for a date to be fixed. 

&gt; Nagaenthran had appeared in court at about 12 minutes ahead of his appeal hearing surrounded by prison officers, but left before the hearing started. 

&gt; “The judicial execution is scheduled for tomorrow. I cannot imagine as the prisoner has been afflicted with COVID-19, I think it’s our view that the execution can't take place anyway,” said Justice Phang. He is one of the Judges of Appeal alongside Justices Judith Prakash and Kannan Ramesh. 

&gt; Justice Phang added that in this case the court had to “use logic, common sense and humanity”. “It is unfortunate. This is the fault of no one, it just happened.”

&gt; Nagaenthran’s lawyer, Ravi Madasamy and Senior State Counsel Wong Woon Kwong from the Attorney-General’s Chambers expressed surprise at the update.

&gt; A day earlier, High Court judge See Kee Oon had dismissed a day earlier Nagaenthran's application for the stay of execution, after rejecting the defence's argument that he had a mental age below 18. 

&gt; Describing Ravi's belief about Nagaenthran's mental age as ""inadmissible in law"", Justice See noted that Ravi conceded to not possessing the medical expertise to comment on the matter. 

&gt; ""There is no credible basis upon which his assertions as to the plaintiff’s mental age can be considered. Moreover, as Supt Shahrom bin Thamby Ahmad (the officer-in-charge of the unit where Nagaenthran is housed) has made clear in his reply affidavit, Mr Ravi has only met the plaintiff once in the last three years, for a mere 26 minutes in all from 9.20 am to 9.46 am on 2 Nov 2021.""

&gt; ""It would appear that Mr Ravi has never met the plaintiff prior to that meeting either; at any rate, he does not claim to have done so in his affidavit, added Justice See.

&gt; Nagaenthran had been given due process in accordance to the law and that it was not open to him ""to challenge the court’s findings pertaining to his mental responsibility, whether directly or indirectly, in yet another attempt to revisit and unravel the finality of those findings,"" Justice See said.

&gt; He noted that it was not in dispute that Nagaenthran had been assessed to have an IQ of 69. During his trial, the judge had found that Nagaenthran was not suffering from intellectual disability to any degree but accepted that he had borderline intellectual functioning.

&gt; Nagaenthran’s failed application is the latest in a string of appeals to have his death sentence substituted to life imprisonment. His case recently gained momentum with civil activists, who call for the death penalty for him to be dropped in light of his intellectual disability.

&gt; Nagaenthran was arrested and charged in 2009 with importing one packet of granular substance containing not less than 42.72 grammes of diamorphine. The Misuse of Drugs Act provides for the death penalty if the amount of diamorphine imported is more than 15 grammes.

&gt; He was given the death penalty in November 2010. He appealed against his conviction and sentence, and the Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal on 27 July 2011.

&gt; After the amendments to the death penalty regime under the Misuse of Drugs Act came into effect in January 2013, Nagaenthran filed a re-sentencing application in 24 February 2015, to set aside the death sentence imposed on him and to substitute a sentence of life imprisonment in its place.

&gt; The application sought to determine whether he was suffering from an abnormality of mind which substantially impaired his mental responsibility for the offence. The High Court dismissed the application on 14 September 2017, finding that Nagaenthran was not suffering from an abnormality of mind at the time of the offence.

&gt; On 27 March 2015, Nagaenthran filed a judicial review application against the public prosecutor’s decision to not issue a certificate of substantive assistance under Section 33B of the Misuse of Drugs Act. The High Court dismissed the application on 4 May 2018.

&gt; Dr Balakrishnan's comments came after ASEAN issued a strong statement calling the executions ""highly reprehensible"".

&gt; ""The implementation of the death sentences just a week before the 55th ASEAN ministerial meeting is highly reprehensible,"" said Cambodia, this year's ASEAN chair, adding that the execution showed the junta's ""gross lack of will"" to support the bloc's efforts to facilitate dialogue between the military and its opponents.

&gt; Malaysia's Foreign Minister Saifuddin Abdullah also condemned the executions, describing the action as a crime against humanity.

&gt; He added that Myanmar should not be allowed to send political representatives to any international ministerial-level meetings.

&gt; ""We looked at (the executions) as if the junta is making a mockery of the five-point consensus, and I think we really have to look at this very, very seriously,"" Mr Saifuddin told a news conference.

&gt; A spokesman for the Myanmar military said that the men ""were given the right to defend themselves according to court procedure"" and insisted that those executed were not democracy activists, but killers deserving of their punishment.

&gt; ""If we compare their sentence with other death penalty cases, they have committed crimes for which they should have been given death sentences many times,"" said Zaw Min Tun.

&gt; It was unclear how the executions were carried out and when they took place. Family members of the condemned prisoners said on Monday that they had not been informed of the executions beforehand, and had not been allowed to retrieve the bodies.

&gt; A last-minute stay of execution was granted for convicted Malaysian drug trafficker Datchinamurthy Kataiah, who was due to be hung at dawn on Friday, Apr. 29, after a ruling by the Singapore High Court on Apr. 28.

&gt; Datchinamurthy had represented himself before the High Court, and later at another appeal hearing at the Court of Appeal.

&gt; Ruling nearly overturned

&gt; According to local activist Kokila Annamalai, Datchinamurthy was granted a stay of his execution by the High Court.

&gt; The Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) filed an appeal against this ruling, and a hearing at the Court of Appeal was called again at 2:30pm.

&gt; The Court of Appeal ruled in Datchinamurthy's favour, and dismissed the appeal lodged by the AGC.

&gt; This means that Datchinamurthy's stay of execution remains, and he will not be executed on Apr. 29.

&gt; This was confirmed by Singapore lawyer M Ravi in a Facebook post.

&gt; Datchinamurthy's basis for calling for a stay on his execution was that he had a pending civil case before the court that is due to be heard on May 20, 2022.

&gt; The civil case pertains to death row inmates' prison correspondence being forwarded to the AGC without the inmates' consent.

&gt; Background

&gt; Datchinamurthy's stay of execution comes off the back of fellow Malaysian drug trafficker Nagaenthran K. Dharmalingam's execution on Apr. 27.

&gt; A candlelight vigil was held on Apr. 25 at Hong Lim Park for the imminent executions of the two drug traffickers on death row.

&gt; Datchinamurthy was arrested in 2011 for trafficking about 45g of heroin into Singapore, reported AP News.

&gt; SINGAPORE - Malaysian drug trafficker Datchinamurthy Kataiah, who was scheduled to be hanged on Friday (April 29), was granted a stay of execution by the court on Thursday.

&gt; The 36-year-old, who represented himself in court, had sought the stay pending the conclusion of a civil application that he - and other death row inmates - had filed against the Attorney-General (A-G).

&gt; The application, seeking declarations and damages over the disclosure of the inmate's private letters, is fixed for hearing on May 20.

&gt; The stay was granted by the High Court on Thursday morning.

&gt; It was upheld that afternoon after a three-judge Court of Appeal heard and dismissed an appeal by the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC).

&gt; The apex court, which comprised Justices Andrew Phang, Judith Prakash and Belinda Ang, will issue detailed grounds of decision at a later date.

&gt; Datchinamurthy was convicted in April 2015 of trafficking in not less than 44.96g of heroin and given the death penalty.

&gt; His appeal was dismissed in February 2016.

&gt; In January 2020, Datchinamurthy and fellow inmate Gobi Avedian sought to stay their executions, pending investigations into allegations that ""unlawful"" methods were being used in judicial executions.

&gt; In April that year, Datchinamurthy complained to the court that his and Gobi's private letters were being ""illegally copied and forwarded by Prison"" to the AGC.

&gt; The copies of the letters received by the AGC were destroyed in June that year.

&gt; In August, the Court of Appeal dismissed the duo's case.

&gt; The court also ruled that prison officials are not allowed to forward copies of inmates' documents to the AGC without the prisoners' consent or a court order.

&gt; However, the court accepted that it was an oversight in this case.

&gt; Nagaenthran K. Dharmalingam, the Malaysian man who was sentenced to death in Singapore for drug trafficking, was executed by hanging earlier today (Apr. 27, 2022).

&gt; According to Reuters, Nagaenthran's brother confirmed via a telephone call that the execution had been carried out.

&gt; His sister also confirmed the news to the BBC.

&gt; A wake is currently being held in Singapore at 38 Sin Ming Drive.

&gt; It began at 1pm on Apr. 27 and will end at 4pm.

&gt; Nagaenthran's funeral will be held in Ipoh, Malaysia.

&gt; Background

&gt; Nagaenthran was first convicted and sentenced to death in November 2010, after he was caught with a bundle of diamorphine, or heroin, strapped to his thigh in 2009.

&gt; Appeals against his conviction and sentence were dismissed by the Court of Appeal in July 2011.

&gt; After the death penalty regime under the Misuse of Drugs Act was amended, a re-sentencing application was made and dismissed by the High Court in September 2017.

&gt; A further appeal against this decision, as well as a separate judicial review application, were dismissed in May 2019.

&gt; A petition to the president for clemency was also unsuccessful.

&gt; Nagaenthran's case had also attracted international media coverage as rights groups called attention to his intellectual disability and IQ of 69.

&gt; The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said in a Nov. 5, 2021 statement that the High Court found that Nagaenthran ""knew what he was doing"" when he committed the offence.

&gt; In response to media queries, MHA noted that both Singapore's High Court and the Court of Appeal had held that Nagaenthran's mental responsibility was not substantially impaired with regard to his offence.

&gt; ""Nagaenthran was found to have clearly understood the nature of his acts, and he did not lose his sense of judgment of the rightness or wrongness of what he was doing,"" MHA said.

t1,i6dzu2a,t3_ucycdh,2022-04-27 11:40:37,Skiiage,"I posted this in the other thread but it got locked and I need a real response:

Putting aside arguments about the death penalty itself, I want to know why drug trafficking deserves the maximum possible punishment the law can hand out.

If we look at the list of capital crimes in Singapore, it's almost exclusively populated by various forms of murder or encouraging war. So killing somebody or planning to kill somebody, the absolute worst thing you can do.

Also drug trafficking.

If we accept this framing, we are supposed to believe that selling a guy a big bag of weed in an entirely voluntary transaction is basically the same as putting a bag over his head and beating him to death.

""Yes, but drugs ruin lives."" So does problem gambling, should we be hanging everyone who works at Singapore Pools? Or shoot up illegal gambling dens and just straight up execute everyone in them?

The reality of drug use is that most users simply continue to live their lives. The stereotypical rockstar does two lines of cocaine off a stripper's ass before jumping on stage, and if you look at US stats a lot of addicts were just people living with severe pain who had to take opiates to get by and now have a physical dependency that they have to manage some way or another.

It's only when combined with poverty that drug use changes from a kind of bad thing most people can probably live with to a societal issue. It's when people can't afford drugs, or they lose their job and the new ones all need a drug test that the rest of the associated crime starts happening.

Like imagine if drugs were as bad as the propaganda suggests. The pusher sells you a single needle and then you immediately spiral out of control into crippling addiction and poverty. How would the trade survive?

All of this is not to say drugs are harmless and therefore we should legalise all of them immediately. Most of them are pretty bad and it's better for your health not to use them, but they're not a death sentence and therefore it's not morally justifiable to put sellers on the same level as murderers.",singapore,-19,t1_i6dzu2a

Lol @ the brain dead ""Law is the Law"" crowd. The law is the law in Nazi Germany. The law is the law in the American South. Singaporeans worship the fucking Law like an idol. The Law must always be tethered to morality and justice. When the Law only serves practicality and those in power, it becomes evil and unjust.

In the case of the death penalty for drug possession in Singapore, why is the application of it so inconsistent?

Why are the CEO of Marlboro and Tiger Beer exempted from facing the same justice as third world drug mules, when their actions are morally equivalent, namely, the sale, distribution and profiteering of pharmacologically destructive, addictive and harmful substances? Either you hang all traffickers of harmful substances, or you hang none of them.

My personal opinion is that, just as with alcohol and cigarettes, all harmful substances should be legalized and heavily regulated by the government. When you legalize something, you basically destroy the ability for criminals to sell and profit from them. You destroy the black market. Have you seen any illegal alcohol or cigarette gangs? Me neither. Because why would I go to some criminal when I can just go to a 7Eleven and purchase them from a trusted legal brand. Drug use WILL never be eliminated.

&gt; Human rights group Amnesty International Malaysia said last night that the Malaysian police were engaged in reprisal against two rights groups for participating in vigils for Malaysian death row inmate Nagaenthran “Nagen” Dharmalingam.

&gt; The group said police were investigating members of the Bar Council and nonprofit Lawyers for Liberty for their roles in two vigils organized outside the Singapore High Commission in Kuala Lumpur prior to the execution of a man widely believed to have been mentally impaired – a fact disputed by Singaporean officials.

&gt; “This abuse of power—in the form of threats of reprisal against those who participate in peaceful public protests—is unacceptable. The right to gather peacefully is guaranteed under the constitution and under international human rights law,” the group wrote.

&gt; The KL rallies were staged Saturday and Tuesday in conjunction with protests and vigils held in Singapore. Nagen was hanged Wednesday.

&gt; Amnesty International Malaysia called on the police to drop their investigations as the gatherings “ended peacefully.”

&gt; Zaid Malek, Mahajoth Singh and Nabila Khairuddin of Lawyers for Liberty were called in for questioning Saturday and accused of violating Section 9(5) of the Peaceful Assembly Act, and Rule 7 of the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases Act.

&gt; New Sin Yew and Yohendra Nadarajan, co-chairs of the Bar Council’s human rights committee, were expected to give statements next week for organizing Tuesday’s candlelight vigil attended by 80.

&gt; Both Singapore’s Attorney-General’s Chambers and drug enforcement agency have denied that Nagen was handled unfairly, and they insist he was fully aware of what he was doing when he trafficked heroin into Singapore, despite having a reported IQ of 69.

&gt; Another Malaysian death row inmate Datchinamurthy Kataiah, who was scheduled to be executed today, was granted a stay of execution yesterday by the Singapore High Court on the grounds that he has a pending civil case before the court.

&gt; SINGAPORE - No domestic law or international treaty explicitly prohibits the execution of people who have an IQ of less than 70, the Court of Appeal said in written grounds on Wednesday (March 9).

&gt; The court issued two sets of detailed grounds this week to explain why it had dismissed two last-ditch attempts in February by a pair of drug traffickers to stop their scheduled executions.

&gt; In the later bid, lawyer Charles Yeo, who acted for Singaporean Roslan Bakar, 51, and Malaysian Pausi Jefridin, 37, had argued that it was unlawful to execute people who have an IQ of less than 70.

&gt; Mr Yeo contended that Roslan has an IQ of 74, while Pausi has an IQ of 67.

&gt; The apex court said: ""We rejected that argument primarily on the basis that both appellants had been found by the courts to have no abnormality of mind that impaired their responsibility for the offences they had committed.""

&gt; The court stressed that the issue of their mental states has been dealt with in great detail in previous court proceedings, and that evidence from psychiatrists and psychologists has been considered.

&gt; It reiterated that Roslan was the central figure in the drug transaction, while Pausi was able to transport the drugs from Malaysia to Singapore and deliver them with no difficulty.

&gt; The court said it appeared that the men were trying to focus their argument on the basis of IQ because there was no new material which can cast doubts on court findings regarding their mental capacity.

&gt; In any case, said the court, Mr Yeo's argument would apply only to Pausi and not to Roslan.

&gt; The court said Mr Yeo was aware that there is no domestic law which prohibits the execution of persons with an IQ of less than 70.

&gt; Mr Yeo referred to Article 15 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) and to two resolutions passed by the United Nations on the rights of mentally disabled people.

&gt; But the court said: ""Neither Article 15 of the CRPD or any other material relied on by the appellants expressly prohibits the execution of persons who have IQs of less than 70.""

&gt; Roslan and Pausi were convicted in 2010 of trafficking in not less than 96.07g of heroin and sentenced to death.

&gt; Their appeals were dismissed in 2011.

&gt; SINGAPORE - The lawyer acting for convicted drug trafficker Nagaenthran K. Dharmalingam, who is challenging his impending execution on Wednesday (Nov 10) on the basis of intellectual disability, had objected to his client's latest psychiatric and medical records that would have revealed his mental state being disclosed in court on Monday.

&gt; In contradiction to Mr M. Ravi's argument that Nagaenthran suffered from a disability, a senior prison officer who had interacted with Nagaenthran for close to three years also had not seen any abnormal behaviour from the inmate, who was able to request religious counselling after being told that he would be hanged in the near future.

&gt; These points were made by the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) in a statement on Monday after Nagaenthran's application to challenge his execution was dismissed by the High Court.

&gt; The sole factual basis for the application rested on the testimony of Nagaenthran's lawyer, said the AGC.

&gt; Mr Ravi claimed that Nagaenthran ""did not appear… to understand what is happening to him in respect of the impending execution of his sentence of death"", said the AGC.

&gt; Mr Ravi also asserted his ""firm belief"" that 33-year-old Nagaenthran has a mental age of a person below 18 years of age.

&gt; In its statement, the AGC noted that Nagaenthran - who was arrested in 2009 with a bundle of heroin strapped to his thigh - undergoes regular medical and psychiatric assessments in prison.

&gt; On Nov 5, the AGC wrote to Mr Ravi to seek Nagaenthran's consent to disclose to the court the records of his latest assessments.

&gt; The AGC said Mr Ravi did not reply and made no attempt to take instructions from Nagaenthran on this issue.

&gt; The chambers said it again asked Mr Ravi at the hearing before Justice See Kee Oon on Monday if Nagaenthran consented to the disclosure of the records.

&gt; AGC said the Singapore Prison Service (SPS) was ready to facilitate an urgent video call for Mr Ravi to take instructions from Nagaenthran.

&gt; ""When asked by the court as to whether he would like to take up the state's offer, Mr Ravi refused, and when asked by the court if he was objecting to the production of the records, Mr Ravi confirmed that he was,"" said the statement.

&gt; The AGC also recounted the testimony of a prison officer to the court that related to his dealings with Nagaenthran.

&gt; The officer said Nagaenthran had no problem communicating with prison officers in English, Malay and Tamil, making requests and responding to instructions.

&gt; When Nagaenthran was notified that he could be hanged in the near future, he asked for religious counselling and a DVD player to play religious songs. He also asked to call his family members and for them to visit him, as well as for his choice of prison officers to attend to his needs in the lead-up to his execution.

&gt; ""Nagaenthran was also able to plan his daily visit and call schedules, and reschedule them in the event of clashes. He continues to communicate coherently and purposefully, and is able to provide contact numbers of relatives and even a childhood friend whom he had not contacted for some time.

&gt; ""In the context of making these arrangements, Nagaenthran had emphasised to the SPS officer that he had a short time left to live.""

&gt; Mr Ravi has filed an appeal, which is being heard on Tuesday.

Western countries might not know a lot about Singapore beyond LKY, SIA, banning chewing gum and “Disney land with the death penalty”. But as general principle they are impressed by the “third world to first” narrative. Delegations of Westerners come here to **learn from** Singapore. How do these guys have such an efficient government? How do they run their economy with such low taxation? How on earth did they develop a public housing system that didn’t result in ghettos. They’re growing beef in pietri dishes over there! We need some Singapore in our country!

So on the hand they are impressed by how advanced Singapore is (especially given its limitations). But they then struggle to square this forward thinking with the death penalty (and previously section 377A). “How can they be so modern and yet have such backward policies on drugs and homosexuality? I don’t understand.”

Some of you might say “why do they always criticise us. Why don’t they criticise [insert other country that has death penalty]?”  Well again it’s because they don’t think as much of those countries. They hold Singapore to higher standards because on any other metric Singapore meets (and generally exceeds) those standards. They can’t understand how Singapore exceeds these standards but drops well below (in their view) on the death penalty.

Of course 80% (or whatever the number from the survey) of Singaporeans don’t see this as incongruous. But from a western lens it is. From a western lens it’s illogical to be so modern and backward (in their view) at the same time. 

Now someone will say “yeah but they also incongruous because they do X”. Well of course. Never seen a hypocrite before issit? SG don’t have?

It cuts both ways. The word “Western” is a perfect example (yes I am hypocrite also). “Western” is used by many people here as a synonym for “USA”. Or more accurately the worst parts of US policy or culture. The “West” isn’t a monolith, even among the English speaking countries. Take the death penalty. Australia, NZ and UK got rid of it a long ago. The US still has it. But here also the US isn’t a monolith. 23 states don’t have it. Same with gun crime. There is variation between US states in gun regulation and gun deaths. Massachusetts has 3 gun deaths per 100,000. Mississippi has 34! But people here will give you the impression that the entirety of the US’s 50 states is like the south side of Chicago. That obviously isn’t true.

So what’s the answer? Don’t know. Just reveals to me that for all the discussion of globalisation there is actually a lot of differences between countries.",singapore,42,t1_jhsi1up

Very extremely, one sided view. 

And speaking as someone, again who find giving death penalty for weed absolutely ridiculous, nobody on the anti-death penalty for drugs side seems to argue on the merits of the litigation itself. 

Yes, he didn't touch the drugs, but that's because he ordered people to do it. 

He's not some small time trafficker. He had weed beyond the limit, and even after purity testing. 

You can disagree on the merits of death penalty, but you can't really argue he didn't deserve it, because there's already plenty of evidence that, I feel, is pretty objective. He's been given the opportunity to defend himself, and it didn't reached the legal requirement as set out by the law. You know that even though in drug trafficking cases, it's considered guilty before proven innocent (you can argue about this in another part) but there is still a trial, at the very least. 

If he had like purity levels below 500gms then he will just get prison. If he is nice, get out of prison. 

1kg isn't like personal consumption level of weed leh.

The thing is each side's opinion seem very extreme. Nobody seem to agree on one thing. Facts are facts, and the anti-drug protests are arguing on the fact that he didn't touch, no translator, and phone number he didn't know. 

Y'all could had at least argued on the merits that weed itself isn't as harmful as it once thought it was, that the current more Liberal outlook on Cannabis is making it pointless to give out death penalty, the medicinal properties are helpful etc.

Also doesn't help that the transformative justice IG intentionally limits the IG comments because they know there will be a lot of people who disagree with their perspective. 

Thing is, the anti-death penalty advocates have their heart in the right place. But, they are just using their anger and disappointment to fuel their own voices. Instead of going with a more level headed approach. Using very dismissive protesting method is very difficult to get more moderate voices on your side, and it alienates the moderate people, who may be for death penalty, but isn't given a compelling argument for why they should listen to the other side. You have essentially shut off people who could be on your side.

But yall went with false presumptions instead. 

Then the other camp, the pro-death penalty ones, simply say 'oh if you take weed you become a meth fueled drug addict, destroy families, eat babies!!' 

Like come on. If that were the case, then is places like Thailand, Amsterdam, LA covered with baby eating monsters? No. US has a opioid crisis, Netherlands has a organised gang problem, and Thailand also has issues with harder drugs, namely from regions of the golden triangle. None of it has to be with the Liberal use of Cannabis. Even statespeople like Obama has revealed he used it in his early years in university, is he some evil person who take drugs and destroy families? I don't know you tell me? 

CNB cites very poor research studies to justify their case for why they find marijuana harmful, despite the clear and growing peer reviewed studies and statistics that criminalising weed does not help, and marijuana has medical uses for people in hospice care and epilepsy cases. 

They have a 'holier than thou' attitude, despite the evidence arguing against their flimsy research they've cited from research sources they've done themselves, government affiliated, or predisposed to their bias. 

So please, look at the facts of the case, look at the medical papers on marijuana, good or bad (weed does has its bad but its no worse than alcohol and cigarettes) and then come to a objective conclusion based on the facts and circumstances.

Suggest anything harsher and they'll go on about not infringing human rights, nevermind that they're peddling these drugs to your kids.

&gt; The Central Narcotics Bureau in Singapore has put up a Facebook post on April 28 to reiterate that executed drug trafficker Nagaenthran A/L Dharmalingam, 34, was not intellectually disabled.

&gt; So far, the insistence that he was intellectually disabled was put forth by those who tried to get his death sentence commuted.

&gt; CNB's post came a day after Nagaenthran was hanged in Changi Prison Complex in the early morning of April 27.

&gt; What CNB reiterated

&gt; In its post, CNB reiterated four facts.

&gt; It said Nagaenthran was caught at Woodlands Checkpoint carrying nearly 0.5kg of a powdery substance that contained at least 42g of pure heroin that was strapped to his thigh.

&gt; He was convicted and sentenced on Nov. 22, 2010, and had several applications and appeals against his conviction and sentence heard and rejected by the courts in Singapore over the years.

&gt; A psychiatrist called by the defence on Nagaenthran’s behalf had agreed in court that the accused was not intellectually disabled.

&gt; The assertion that Nagaenthran possessed the mental age of a person below 18 years of age was put forth by his lawyer in 2021, who then refused to consent to have Nagaenthran’s latest medical and psychiatric reports placed before the court.

&gt; CNB issued longer statement a day earlier

&gt; The post also pointed to a longer statement issued by CNB a day earlier after Nagaenthran was executed.

&gt; The statement said: ""There has been much misinformation that has been put out in relation to Nagaenthran, in particular on his mental state. The above are the facts, as found by the courts.""

&gt; The statement also highlighted that the Singapore courts had determined that Nagaenthran's behaviour when he was about to get caught for trafficking at that time showed that he was “capable of manipulation and evasion”.

&gt; He attempted to stop a search of his belongings by appealing to the social perception of the trustworthiness of security officers by saying he was ""working in security"".

&gt; He was also noted to have “continuously"" altered his account of his education qualifications to lower it each time he was interviewed.

&gt; The CNB statement concluded with the observation that capital punishment was also recently carried out in the United States where the persons on death row had IQ ranges similar to Nagaenthran.

&gt; CNB wrote: ""It should be noted that in the U.S., two persons were executed in October 2021. They had IQ ranges of 64–72 and 63–95 respectively, similar to Nagaenthran. The U.S. Courts dismissed arguments relating to their alleged intellectual disability.""

&gt; AGC refutes claims as well

&gt; The Attorney-General’s Chambers separately has also refuted claims on April 27 morning, following the execution, that Nagenthran’s process was unfair, and denied that there were conflicts of interest in the proceedings.

&gt; In the last-minute April 25 motion filed by Nagaenthran and his mother Panchalai Supermaniam, supposedly with the help of friends and social activists, they sought a stay of execution and argued that it was unconstitutional to carry out the death sentence because Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon, who presided over Nagaenthran’s previous failed appeals, was also the Attorney-General during his conviction.

&gt; The court on Tuesday heard the criminal motion and noted that Chief Justice Menon was not involved in any decisions pertaining to Nagaenthran’s prosecution during his tenure as Attorney-General from Oct. 1, 2010 to June 24, 2012.

&gt; The AGC added that Nagaethran had no objections in 2016 to Chief Justice Menon hearing his matters.

&gt; It was brought to Nagaethran’s counsel’s attention at that time that Chief Justice Menon’s tenure as Attorney-General overlapped with their client’s criminal proceedings.

&gt; The AGC also noted that the last-ditch application on Monday was the seventh such application, not including appeals, that was brought by Nagaenthran after his appeal against conviction was dismissed by the Court of Appeal in 2011.

t1,i6shmkt,t3_uf403t,2022-04-30 14:05:51,ComprehensiveEye2105,"A lot of people focus on his IQ level but what a lot of people should really focus is the bigger picture of how anti drug laws are different from other criminal laws in the country.

The big issue is the presumption of guilt as opposed to the presumption of innocence. The misuse of drugs act presume you are guilty unless you prove you are innocent. This is different from the rest of Singapore’s criminal law which starts with the presumption of innocence. If you are familiar in statistics, this difference in assumption leads to either type 1 or type 2 errors in hypothesis testing. In the former, there is potential for innocent people wrongly found guilty, while in the later, there is the potential for guilty people wrongly found innocent.

If you believe in rule of law, all laws should be set up consistently. Either have the default presumption of innocence or default presumption of guilt.

The second issue that most people do not understand is that the death penalty is mandatory. It means the hands of the judge are tied when issuing the death sentence. It means all guilty cases automatically get the death penalty if they meet the criteria regardless of circumstances.

These are the nuances in the debate that a lot of Singaporeans are unaware of. 

That being said, if foreigners are unhappy with these laws in the country, then they should not step foot inside Singapore. There are other countries (North Korea or Saudi Arabia) with harsher laws that I personally do not agree with that I wouldn’t visit.",singapore,18,t1_i6shmkt

&gt; The only post on Tan Mei Qian's Instagram profile is a picture of her and two friends delivering a letter to Singapore's President.

&gt; The letter contained a request to spare the life of Datchinamurthy Kataiah, a 36-year-old man who has been languishing on death row for the past seven years.

&gt; His crime - trafficking 44 grams of heroin, around three tablespoons worth, into Singapore.

&gt; ""The media is heavily censored. So there is little opportunity for us to raise our opinions here,"" Ms Tan said.

&gt; But that changed last month when another man, Nagaenthran K Dharmalingham, was executed for smuggling drugs into Singapore from Malaysia.

&gt; His hanging sparked a debate as young, aware and globally conscious Singaporeans began speaking up, mostly on social media - an unusual occurrence in politically passive Singapore.

&gt; In the days before Nagaenthran's execution, around 400 people gathered at Hong Lim park - the sole place in Singapore where protests are largely allowed without prior police approval.

&gt; In the past, rallies held there had attracted crowds of less than 50.

&gt; But this, a demonstration to halt the execution, was a watershed moment, activists say.

&gt; ""Nagaenthran's case galvanised many in Singapore and made everyone realise how unforgiving and brutal our punishment system is,"" Jolovan Wham, the protest organiser, told the BBC.

&gt; Nagaenthran was handed the death sentence for strapping 43 grams of heroin to his thigh.

&gt; In the months leading up to his hanging, his lawyers and family filed appeals and clemency requests asking for his death sentence to be commuted on the grounds that he was intellectually disabled.

&gt; One assessment found him to have an IQ of 69, a level internationally recognised as a learning disability.

&gt; But the courts rejected the claim and found that he knew what he was doing at the time of the offence.

&gt; There was hope that the pandemic, which led to a two year pause in executions, would alter Nagaenthran's fate.

&gt; But on April 27th, he was hung at dawn.

&gt; Most Singaporeans support the use of the death penalty but Nagaenthran's case has ignited debate over capital punishment.

&gt; Singapore's government says its strict drug laws, including the death penalty, are an effective deterrent against crime, making it one of the safest places in Asia.

&gt; Just over a month before Nagaenthran's execution, Singapore's Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam told parliament that the majority of residents still support the death penalty and consider it appropriate punishment for drug trafficking. He was referring to preliminary findings from a 2021 survey.

&gt; But he did concede that young Singaporeans' support for capital punishment for drug traffickers was lower than the national average.

&gt; The responses to Ms Tan's post reflect these findings: ""lol go study lah and I hope you never ever get to experience the destruction drugs cause to both the addicts and their loved ones,"" one comment reads.

&gt; Another says, ""Please la girl don't fall prey to this nonsense... propaganda. You have no idea what a drug-run state looks like"".

&gt; But Ms Tan is hopeful.

&gt; ""I think we are going in a good direction because there is a lot more conversation about it.""

&gt; The increased awareness has been a crutch for the families of those on death row.

&gt; Datchina's family feels stronger and more resolute about his case because of what they saw at Hong Lim Park, said Kirsten Han, who has been campaigning against the death penalty for more than a decade.

&gt; ""That is very distinct from other cases that I've worked on. Singaporeans are trying to find action to take themselves,"" she adds.

&gt; Nagaenthran's case prompted criticism from the UN, an EU representative and global figures like billionaire Richard Branson. International rights groups called it a ""tragic miscarriage of justice"".

&gt; ""For the first time I see a group of people are voicing out against the death penalty. Social media is full of Nagaenthran's case across so many industries - business, actors, ministers,"" said Angelia Pranthaman whose 31-year-old brother Pannir Selvam Pranthaman is also on death row, awaiting an execution date.

&gt; Activists who have been trawling through court judgements and speaking to families estimate that there are more than 60 people currently on death row in Singapore.

&gt; Prisoners - and their families - appeal their cases in Singapore's courts, often representing themselves because lawyers are unwilling to take on late-stage cases.

&gt; As efforts continue to save those who have received execution notices, some are questioning the punishment itself.

&gt; Amnesty International says out of the 10 death sentences handed out in Singapore during the pandemic - one sentence was handed out on Zoom - eight were for drug offences.

&gt; Singapore is also one of the few countries in the world that have mandatory death sentences for drug crimes - those caught carrying more than 15g of heroin are subject to the death penalty.

&gt; UN experts have said the death sentence is disproportionate for the amount of drugs in question. Many also say those convicted are victims of a larger problem.

&gt; ""Our system is such that we impose the harshest penalty on the mules. But unfortunately the drug lords behind the mules are still doing their business in other countries,"" criminal lawyer Suni Sudheesan said.

&gt; Experts say there is a global shift towards abolishing the death penalty, and that Singapore is an outlier among developed nations.

&gt; That said, Asia is home to the top executioner in the world.

&gt; China is believed to execute thousands of people every year, but official data is not publicly available.

&gt; Indonesia continues to use the death penalty for drug trafficking but hasn't carried out an execution since 2016.

&gt; Singapore's neighbour Malaysia has a moratorium on executions and has amended its law, but Human Rights Watch says judges continue to hand out death sentences, rather than life imprisonment, in the majority of cases.

&gt; Other countries in Southeast Asia - Philippines, Myanmar and Thailand - no longer have capital punishment.

&gt; ""Singapore's international reputation has already deteriorated significantly with the execution of Nagaenthran,"" said the Anti-Death Penalty Asia Network in a statement after his death.

&gt; Despite renewed calls from across the world for Singapore to reconsider capital punishment and existing death sentences, abolition or even a moratorium on executions seems unlikely in the near future.

&gt; ""It won't happen too soon, but I have been encouraged by the number of young people who are taking action,"" Mr Wham said.

&gt; ""I'm optimistic.""

But that same mother did not protect her daughter. The mother took her daughter out of the safety of her aunt's home, and did not take sufficient steps to make sure the molester was never left alone with her daughter. Her daughter was molested just **two** days after going home.

&gt; SINGAPORE: A man who was previously sentenced to jail for molesting his underage stepdaughter reoffended after being released from prison.

&gt; The girl, now 14, had a nervous breakdown after the latest sexual intrusion and ran away. She now lives in a care home.

&gt; The 32-year-old man, who cannot be named due to gag orders imposed by the court, was sentenced on Thursday (Feb 16) to three years' jail and eight strokes of the cane for the new offences.

&gt; He pleaded guilty to two charges of molestation, with a third charge taken into consideration.

&gt; The court heard that the man was previously sentenced to 26 months' jail and three strokes of the cane for offences, including molesting the victim.

&gt; He was released on remission on Aug 17, 2020, with the remission order running until May 7, 2021.

&gt; Due to his previous offences against his stepdaughter, she could not stay with her mother in the family home after the accused was released.

&gt; Instead, she stayed with her maternal uncle and aunt.

&gt; After the offender was released, efforts were made to reintegrate the family. Around May 2021, the accused was allowed to interact with the victim at her aunt's place, in the presence of the victim's mother and uncle.

&gt; The family, including the accused and the victim, also went on staycations. As the victim and her mother felt that ""everything was OK"", they trusted that nothing untoward would happen again.

&gt; On Jun 28, 2021, the victim was staying temporarily with her maternal grandparents when her mother and the accused went to visit her.

&gt; Her mother decided that she would bring the victim back to stay at the family home.

&gt; However, just two days later, when the rest of the family had gone to sleep, the offender struck again.

&gt; The victim's mother was asleep in her room with a baby, and the victim's stepsiblings were also sleeping.

&gt; The offender was playing the video game Mobile Legends with the victim in the living room, when he began to molest her.

&gt; She froze and did not know how to react, but the man continued to molest her until he noticed her discomfort.

&gt; He stopped, apologised and said: ""Don't tell anyone as (I do) not want to go back to jail.""

&gt; The victim did not respond and later fell asleep. However, she was woken up by the accused grabbing a hold of her hand and forcing her to commit a sex act.

&gt; That same day, the victim went to stay with her aunt and told her that she felt nauseous.

&gt; That evening, her aunt noticed that the victim was crying to herself and asked what was wrong. The victim revealed that her stepfather had molested her.

&gt; Over the next two days, the victim informed her child protection officer about the offences and lodged a report against her stepfather.

&gt; Immediately after lodging the report, the victim had a nervous breakdown and ran away from her aunt's home. As a result, her aunt and uncle did not wish to continue caring for her.

&gt; IMPACT ON THE VICTIM

&gt; The victim was seen at the Child Guidance Clinic of the Institute of Mental Health in January 2022, and said she had nightmares and flashbacks.

&gt; Her studies have also been badly affected, the court heard.

&gt; The accused was arrested and interviewed by the police, but initially denied having any sexual contact with the victim.

&gt; His DNA was later found on the victim's underwear.

&gt; Deputy Public Prosecutor Chong Kee En asked for 24 to 28 months' jail and six to nine strokes of the cane for the offender.

&gt; He said the accused was a repeat sexual offender ""in every sense of the word"", committing sexual offences against his young stepdaughter barely a month after his remission order had expired.

&gt; Mr Chong said there was an abuse of trust, and that the victim was trying to forgive her stepfather for the first offence.

&gt; ""She agreed to go back to live with them ... as she heartbreakingly revealed, 'I wanted to give my mother the chance to feel like she has one happy family again',"" said Mr Chong.

&gt; He said the offender ""has sullied both the notion of family and of forgiveness"".

&gt; ""The accused has clearly not learnt his lesson even after being punished for his previous sexual offences,"" said Mr Chong.

&gt; ""We urge this honourable court to impose a suitably deterrent sentence against him so that this time, the lesson sticks.""

&gt; The accused was allowed to begin his jail term in May, after his wife, who has forgiven him, gives birth to her latest child.

Jurong island or Bukom make much more sense in terms of infrastructure and for the simple fact that they have massive concrete seawalls. Zombies would have to pile up 30-50 meters underwater to scale them. 

Also, SG can defend itself quite well imho, once you get all reservists on coastal duty to light up anything that comes even close to any of our landmasses or emerges from the water. SG is terribly convenient to fortify and to supply logistically. 

In terms of supplies, SG has been stockpiling rice and other goods since the 70s in the Jurong Caves, along with fuel and ammunition. So running out of actual rationed food, not toilet paper, will not be a concern for a few years. Same for rationed water. 

Also, the government will retreat to the various bunkers in Tekong, Bukit Timah, Jurong etc., not to an island to live on top of. Bunkers have supplies for decades and full governance facilities and infrastructure control.

I always imagined Singapore would somewhat succeed like Israel did in the book.

Most likely we would start by destroying all the land bridges to and from Malaysia and swiftly halt all air travel. This will prevent the zombies from ever getting in. Singapore also has numerous fences built all around the island and a robust surveillance system maintained by SPF to prevent illegal immigrants from easily crossing into Singapore which can help to detect and prevent zombies or infected individuals from crossing by water.

Singapore has been preparing to be entirely self-sufficient in terms of water for a long time with food also a close second. With rationing and effective planning and mobilisation, I think the government will mobilise reservists to kickstart farming and water catchment initiatives maybe in the Kranji area. A problem the US had is that the soldiers would desert because their families were far away and they felt they had to leave to protect them but this would not affect SG as we all live very close so it wouldn’t have the same effect for the soldiers in SG.

Public defence initiatives like SGSecure and other apps will ensure any viral infections are detected and contained early. (Kiasu Singaporeans will call police at the first sign of trouble). Most likely Singapore will roll out more apps and initiatives to help Singaporeans manage and track their zombie status as well as others in the community.

I imagine Pulau Ubin will be a quarantine area for refugees looking to enter Singapore and Tekong will be the base of operations and fallback position for the Singapore government if all goes to hell with Sentosa acting as the equivalent for the rich.

Also note that Israel had many times more refugees and zombies streaming to Israel (in the same region, we only have a few million people in Southern Malaysia and disjointed islands to contend with).

Considering our high per km of coast concentration of security forces and surveillance assets, holding off hordes of zombies and boat people shouldn't be an issue for even current peactime capacity of MINDEF/MHA units.

Our short-term issue would be eradictating internal infestation; this will be make or break. If we fail here, it's underground bunker and small pocket defence time (similar to your scenario). In the medium to long-term, securing resources for our survival (chiefly food, energy and goods) will be crucial but not as bad as you make it out (others have pointed out we store several years worth of provisions in underground caverns.

Below is my proposed policy and if the SG govt shows greater neural activity than those zombies, they should do something similar (in anycase, a zombie apocalypse sounds like a great excuse to rollback democracy):



Phase I (Early Times - Israel seals off; South Africa outbreak):

As cited in the book, Israel's 10th man doctrine gives them early warning (fun fact: I've talked to the Israeli director in charge of this department). With our security relationship, Mossad warns SID of the true nature of this virus (and that dogs can be used to screen out infected people) and we follow suit (but slightly later and with not as extreme measures).

The state declares internal lockdown and SARS-style protocols. MOH and healthcare workers strain themselves and must be supported by the Army to deal with internal infestations. This is effective for the zombies cited in the book. The ones in the movie (running and fast-infecting)...not so much but we should adapt by arming medical teams with police revolvers, providing security trooper escorts and bite-proof Kevlar suits. We will inevitably vaccinate the population with the placebo (not that it works).

Borders are closed. A limited number of reservists are called. The causeway points are heavily reinforced with soldiers too. The refugees are turned away for the most part and led to our neighbours who are not as lucky in stemming the flow. The toughest part would be the causeways but we can adapt the Israeli policy of letting in Palestinians by permitting fleeing Malaysians to screen past dogs before joining us.

Singapore returns to a 1970s style LKY authoritarianism but this time with modern digital surveillance. Dissent and migrant worker protests are crushed with protest ringleaders hanged. Censorship is far tighter to prevent panic and POFMA is used liberally.



Phase II (Great Panic - placebo fails; world goes in chaos):

GDP and trade plummets and we are forced to rely on our fuel and food reserves. Rationing is implemented and many industries are nationalised in what is essentially a command economy (aided with AI and computerisation though so it isn't as inefficient as the Soviet Union). By this time, nearly all reservists are mobilised for security or farming/manufacturing of strategic goods (e.g. textiles, machinery, electronics, ammunition/weapons).

Anyway, we have our own Battle of Yonkers at the the two checkpoints but I think we should win handily considering we have a more defensible chokepoint and less numbers to deal with than the US. Also I really don't know how the US army screwed up, like just drive any armoured vehicle over the zombies...you don't even need ammunition.

Nonetheless, assuming we're retarded and we still face say hundreds of deaths, the armed forces council gets scared and eventually female conscription is introduced. If you look at the SAF Act, no gender is specified so this doesn't even need parliamentary approval (it has simply been a matter of execution that MINDEF/MHA have not called up females).

Dictatorial powers are awarded to the PAP and Administrative Service. Elections are cancelled indefinitely. The ISD is permitted to execute rulebreakers through summary trials without judicial ruling and SPF/SAF units are cleared to fire on sight at zombies or infected. Think in between China and North Korea level of totalitarianism. 

If Phase I doesn't deal with the internal infestation, this will. In a sense, considering how networked and built up we are, our odds are decent (furthermore, Singapore with its history, is one of the easiest places to implement such harsh measures).

To stop the masses of refugees from the sea and air, RSAF should enforce a no-fly zone with CAP (Combat-Air Patrol). Any intruders can be shot down with SAMs or fighter jets. The RSN should he given permission to sink refugee boats if we can't handle the numbers.



Phase III (Post Battle of Yonkers):

So the international community is no longer a community. Globalisation is dead. Wars have broken out everywhere. Various governments have fallen or evacuated to safe zones (Redeker plan). Nuclear war has broken out in South Asia and Iran. The RSN will have to be a pirate fleet as you said.

Here, with female conscription enforced, we should launch a full-scale invasion of Southern Malaysia and select Riau islands of Indonesia. With their respective countries already in chaos, the SAF has little issue obliterating their conventional forces and their governments can do little beyond token defence. The Johor Sultan finally makes good his threat to secede and agrees to join Singapore (not that he has much of a choice). Nonetheless, he is granted a position similar to a very weak monarch and a luxurious lifestyle for his family. 

For this invasion, we will need to use our full manpower of both males and female conscripts to police and pacify the occupied areas of zombies. This isn't a deadly mission but very tedious, time-consuming and manpower intensive. However, the land area isn't particularly massive and unlike in the real world, we can afford to advance very slowly since Malaysia/Indonesia are in no position to rearm and counterattack and the UN and great powers are silent.

With the successful takeover, Singapore can secure the plentiful oil/gas fields of Riau, water supplies of Johor, far more land for cultivation of crops and a greater population for manufacturing of much-needed industrial goods. We may even end rationing though food variety and consumer goods are nowhere near post-Z levels. Obviously.



Phase IV (Striking Back):

Our experience (in pacification of non-home territories) and general intactness of military/production capabilities should allow us to be one of big voices in the shattered UN. Here we should be nice and help out where we can so that in a recovered globe, the great powers will accept (or at least ignore) our conquering.

However, just to be kiasu, we should obtain nuclear plans and know-how from Israel. Offer them whatever they want. Other raw materials can be easily imported (IAEA has better things to do like dealing with an irradiated subcontinent). Start building nuclear power plants and develop a small nuclear arsenal (say 100 warheads and some ballistic missiles). That should really secure our place in a post World War Z world.",singapore,8,t1_izq4l05
t1,izn3x6w,t3_zhjsss,2022-12-10 09:28:40,roguedigit,"I think people overlook one main thing when hypothesizing a zombie apocalypse and that's how quickly it will actually end.

For it to actually reach catastrophic levels where you're only left with 0.1% of humanity left, a zombie strain would have to work incredibly fast, and yes - the zombies would have to be rabid and running. Also, the strain would have to hit multiple continents at around the same time, because quarantining an island, or even a landlocked continent could be done very, very quickly.

Assuming the above 2 scenarios happen, and you're lucky enough to be one of the 0.1% of people not part of the undead and holing up in an apartment or secure area, all you'd have to do is procure enough water and food for a week or two at most. Why?

Zombies rot. This is simply applying what we know scientifically, that the only purpose of a parasite is to use its host to spread - and eventually it reaches a definite critical point where the only other thing around would be other parasite hosts. In a couple of weeks at most (and that's generous), the only threat zombies would be are minor, crawling annoyances - and that's assuming they aren't picked off by wildlife.

IMO, the true fear of a zombie apocalypse wouldn't be the undead, it would be coping with the existential dread of how to rebuild civilization. On one hand, survivors would have all the material resources needed to simply stay alive. Clothes, fire, tools, water, plants, shelter, etc - and quite literally all the time in the world to spend at libraries learning more specialized topics.

On the other hand, individuals like electricians, engineers, mechanics, woodworkers, would be essential in rebuilding society to any semblance of what it was, but there's the very real possibility that survivors simply can't amass enough numbers or specialization to dream about anything beyond just living another day. It also goes without saying that if you have a chronic illness and need constant medication, you're quite literally fucked.

&gt; SINGAPORE — The Court of Appeal on Thursday (May 23) granted an eleventh-hour appeal by Pannir Selvam Pranthaman for a stay of his execution. He was supposed to be hanged in Changi Prison on Friday morning.

&gt; The 31-year-old Malaysian was convicted in 2017 of trafficking 51.84g of diamorphine, also known as heroin, into Singapore through Woodlands Checkpoint in September 2014.

&gt; Pannir, who was not represented by lawyers before Thursday, had filed the application for the stay of execution himself on Wednesday.

&gt; Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon, who heard the case with Judges of Appeal Judith Prakash and Steven Chong, noted that Pannir was informed of his execution date and President Halimah Yacob’s rejection of his clemency petition only a week in advance.

&gt; This left him with little time to get legal advice on his options, and he should be given the chance to do so, they said.

&gt; Pannir’s lawyers, Mr Too Xing Ji and Mr Lee Ji En from BMS Law LLC, stepped in only a few hours before the Court of Appeal hearing on Thursday afternoon.

&gt; Mr Too told the court that he had taken instructions from his client just 10 minutes before the hearing, and Chief Justice Menon acknowledged that the lawyers could not be expected to present fully developed arguments.

&gt; Mr Too called for a stay of execution as they intend to challenge the rejection of the clemency petition, by way of judicial review.

&gt; To that, Chief Justice Menon said: “There are extremely narrow grounds upon which the clemency process may be so impugned. However, in our judgment, the applicant ought to have a reasonable opportunity to take advice on whether he can mount a successful challenge.”

&gt; Following the stay of execution, he ordered the following:

&gt; 

&gt; 

&gt; Pannir should file his intended application to challenge the clemency process within the next two weeks, along with supporting evidence.

&gt; 

&gt; 

&gt; The prosecution has two weeks to respond.

&gt; 

&gt; 

&gt; Both parties are to file further submissions within one week.

&gt; 

&gt; 

&gt; The appropriate court will then hear the matter at short notice.

&gt; 

&gt; 

&gt; ‘COMPLETE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY’

&gt; During the hearing, the court heard that Pannir’s family received two letters, dated May 17, 2019, in the same courier mail package.

&gt; One was from the Singapore Prison Service confirming his date of execution on May 24, while another was from the Istana, stating that his clemency petition had been rejected.

&gt; This “troubled” Pannir, Mr Too said.

&gt; Affidavits from the President Halimah’s principal private secretary, Mr Benny Lee, as well as Pannir himself, laid out the sequence of events before May 17.

&gt; 

&gt; 

&gt; Sometime before May 7: President Halimah decided to reject the clemency petition, on advice from the Cabinet.

&gt; 

&gt; 

&gt; Around May 7: Mr Benny Lee signed letters informing Pannir, as well as his parents and siblings in Malaysia, of the decision. The letters were each dated May 17.

&gt; 

&gt; 

&gt; May 14: The Istana sent these letters to the prison authorities to be delivered.

&gt; 

&gt; 

&gt; May 16: The two letters from the prison and the Istana were posted by mail to Pannir’s family.

&gt; 

&gt; 

&gt; Mr Too said that this showed “a complete lack of transparency in the clemency process”.

&gt; He noted the uncertainty surrounding when exactly President Halimah decided to reject the petition, what the decision-making process was, and the lack of reasons why the letters were post-dated.

&gt; The lawyer also suggested that the Attorney-General’s Chambers should set out a “full chronology of when the decision was made, and why it was not conveyed earlier”.

&gt; “I’m inviting Your Honours to draw the inference that this process has been infected by a sense of casualness,” Mr Too added.

&gt; CONVICTION AND SENTENCE

&gt; In its grounds of decision on the case in 2017, the High Court found that Pannir was a mere drug courier, but the judge imposed the mandatory death penalty after the public prosecutor did not issue him a certificate of substantial assistance.

&gt; Under the Misuse of Drugs Act, judges have the discretion to impose life imprisonment or the death penalty on drug couriers who have either been certified by the public prosecutor to have substantively assisted the Central Narcotics Bureau during investigations, or have proven themselves to be mentally impaired.

&gt; The last reported execution in Singapore happened in March. In 2015, Micheal Garing, a Malaysian, was convicted of murder and sentenced to hang by the High Court. His death sentence was affirmed by the Court of Appeal in 2017.

&gt; SINGAPORE - The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has slammed Malaysia non-governmental organisation Lawyers for Liberty's (LFL) allegations against Singapore's execution method as ""untrue, baseless and preposterous"".

&gt; It has also ordered the LFL and three parties that have spread the allegations - activist Kirsten Han, The Online Citizen and Yahoo Singapore - to correct the false statements.

&gt; It is the fifth case where the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (Pofma) has been invoked since it came into effect on Oct 2 last year.

&gt; On Jan 16, the Malaysia-based LFL said in a statement that prison officers in Singapore were ""given special training to carry out the brutal execution method"" and that the Singapore Government approved of the ""unlawful methods"" that are used to cover up an execution if the rope breaks.

&gt; ""These allegations are entirely unfounded,"" MHA said on Wednesday (Jan 22).

&gt; Singapore executes its condemned prisoners by hanging.

&gt; The ministry said that all judicial executions in Singapore are carried out in strict compliance with the law.

&gt; ""All judicial executions are conducted in the presence of the Superintendent of the Prison and a medical doctor, among others. The law also requires a Coroner (who is a Judicial Officer of the State Courts) to conduct an inquiry within 24 hours of the execution to satisfy himself that the execution was carried out duly and properly,"" MHA said.

&gt; It added: ""For the record, the rope used for judicial executions has never broken before, and prison officers certainly do not receive any 'special training to carry out the brutal execution method' as alleged. Any acts such as those described in the LFL statement would have been thoroughly investigated and dealt with.""

&gt; The ministry said that the LFL has a history of publishing sensational and untrue stories to seek attention in hopes of getting Malaysian prisoners who have been convicted of drug trafficking and sentenced to death in Singapore off the death penalty.

&gt; ""Those who traffic drugs in Singapore, harm and destroy the lives of countless Singaporeans. These traffickers must be prepared to face the consequences of their actions,"" MHA said.

&gt; In November 2019, convicted Malaysian drug trafficker Abd Helmi Ab Halim had his death sentence carried out after an unsuccessful petition to Singapore's President for clemency.

&gt; In May 2019, Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam said that almost 30 per cent of drug traffickers caught in Singapore in 2018 were Malaysians, and nearly 30 per cent of the heroin seized, by weight, was brought in by Malaysians. He added that one in five traffickers who brought in drugs above the threshold that brings the death penalty was also a Malaysian.

&gt; Related Story Fake news law invoked for the first time over Facebook post

&gt; On Wednesday, MHA also said that it has instructed the Pofma office to issue corrections against the LFL as well as three other parties: Ms Han's Facebook post that shared LFL's statement, The Online Citizen which has an article that contained the falsehoods, and Yahoo Singapore's Facebook post which shared an article that contained the falsehoods.

&gt; ""They will be required to carry a correction notice alongside their posts or articles, stating that their posts or articles contain falsehoods,"" MHA said.

&gt; SINGAPORE: Minister for Home Affairs K Shanmugam has rejected an application by The Online Citizen (TOC) to cancel a correction direction issued to it under POFMA (Protection From Online Falsehoods And Manipulation Act).

&gt; The correction direction was issued on Jan 22 against a statement by Malaysian human rights group Lawyers for Liberty (LFL), along with an online article by TOC and separate Facebook posts by activist Kirsten Han and Yahoo Singapore. LFL claimed that Singapore carries out “brutal executions”.

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; In its press release on Friday (Jan 24), the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said: “The conditions for the issuance of the Correction Direction had been satisfied, and the Application did not disclose any grounds to the contrary.”

&gt; Minister Shanmugam decided to reject the application after “having carefully considered it”, MHA said, adding that TOC has been notified.

&gt; The ministry said the article published by TOC on Jan 16 contained falsehoods asserting that “prison officers were instructed to carry out the following brutal procedure whenever the rope breaks during a hanging, which happens from time to time.”

&gt; 

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; It went on to list what it said were the falsehoods in the TOC article:

&gt; 

&gt; The prison officer is instructed to pull the rope around the neck of the prisoner towards him.

&gt; Meanwhile, another prison officer will apply pressure by pulling the body in the opposite direction.

&gt; The first officer must then kick the back of the neck of the prisoner with great force in order to break it.

&gt; The officers are told to kick the back of the neck because that would be consistent with death by hanging.

&gt; The officers are told not to kick more than 2 times, so that there will be no tell-tale marks in case there is an autopsy.

&gt; Strict orders are also given not to divulge the above to other prison staff not involved in executions.

&gt; The correction direction was issued to TOC on Jan 22, the same day MHA issued its statement refuting the allegations as “untrue, baseless and preposterous”.

&gt; ""For the record, the rope used for judicial executions has never broken before, and prison officers certainly do not receive any 'special training to carry out the brutal execution method' as alleged,"" said MHA.

&gt; ""Any acts such as those described in the LFL statement would have been thoroughly investigated and dealt with.""

&gt; 

&gt; TOC was required to insert a correction notice stating that the article contained false statements of fact, with a link to a Factually article that sets out the correct facts.

&gt; In its statement on Jan 22 refuting the article, MHA said: ""LFL has been publishing various falsehoods to seek attention in hopes of getting Malaysian prisoners, who have been convicted of drug trafficking and sentenced to death in Singapore, off the death penalty,"" said MHA.

&gt; ""Regrettably, there are some individuals and groups in Singapore who are spreading LFL’s latest allegations,"" it added.

&gt; Following the issuing of the correction directions, TOC said it had filed an application to Mr Shanmugam to cancel the correction order.

&gt; On Jan 23, Yahoo Singapore added a correction notice to its Facebook post after sharing an article that repeated claims made by LFL.

&gt; A check by CNA on the Facebook post's edit history showed that the notice was added to the post on the morning of Jan 23, a day after the correction direction was issued by the POFMA.

&gt; LFL said it would not comply with the correction direction or challenge it.

&gt; ""We decline to challenge the order in Singapore courts because Singapore has no jurisdiction over us,"" LFL adviser N Surendran told CNA.

If your dumbass jumped off a building, are we to blame for not installing barriers to prevent you from committing suicide? Similarly, there are many options available for non-drug-related work. If you choose to take the risk of smuggling drugs, you have to pay the consequences. 

There are plenty of Singaporeans that lived their lives without requiring any drugs. The only way for any person to get drugs in Singapore is to specifically seek them out and/or find people who source it for them. If you ostensibly decide to hang-out with people who encourage drug-abuse, you have to bear the consequences. 

Either this, or immigrate overseas, so you could smoke weed/ayahuasca without fear of punishment.",singapore,-1,t1_g5juzht

&gt; SINGAPORE - Twenty four prisoners on death row, who sued the Attorney-General alleging that they had been deprived of their right to counsel, had their case thrown out by the Court of Appeal in the early hours of Friday morning (Aug 5).

&gt; One of the inmates, Abdul Rahim Shapiee, who is scheduled to be hanged on Friday (Aug 5), failed in his bid to get a stay of execution.

&gt; The court, comprising Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon and Justices Tay Yong Kwang and Woo Bih Li, delivered its judgment some seven hours after hearing arguments on Thursday afternoon (Aug 4).

&gt; The 24 inmates were led by Iskandar Rahmat, the former policeman sentenced to death for the 2013 Kovan double murder.

&gt; In a hearing held via video conference on Thursday afternoon, Iskandar argued that lawyers were unwilling to act for them in post-appeal applications because they feared being ordered to pay personal costs.

&gt; Under the law, the court can order lawyers to pay costs if the court finds that the legal action is frivolous or vexatious or an abuse of the court process.

&gt; Iskandar argued that the legal provisions that gave the courts the power to impose such costs orders were unconstitutional.

&gt; But Chief Justice Menon said these provisions cannot reasonably deter lawyers from acting in bona fide applications.

&gt; He said such costs orders are imposed in proceedings brought or conducted with some impropriety.

&gt; The costs provisions do not impinge on the right to counsel at all because there can be no right to improperly advance a case, he said.

&gt; As for Abdul Rahim, he had sought a stay of execution pending the resolution of an 11th hour negligence suit he filed against his former lawyer on Wednesday (Aug 3).

&gt; He claimed that the lawyer, who was assigned to defend him during his trial, had failed to follow his instructions to call a certain witness.

He would have been paid an amount commensurate with the risk of being caught and hanged. 

People who want this stuff, go overseas and get it. If you get caught upon return, the consequences only fall on your own head and as a consumer, not a trafficker. Buying it in Singapore means supporting a business that gets people's necks snapped. 

The law may be too harsh, but once caught, it's too late to argue that it is too harsh. The execution itself is not harsh; it's the clearly stated and unambiguous consequence of breaking the law. 

This guy Tangaraju was not even the mule/courier, he was a distributor who got caught in a sting after the courier got caught and spilled the beans to the police.

Then he uses sophistry telling me bunch of nonsense, basically telling me, he will paynow me later, as if we're BFF, and hearing all these, I decided that I will just drop him off at his destination, and once we were there, his Mother was there waiting for us to make the payment, and she ask me the fare and handed over a $50 note which I told her I did not have enough change, and on hearing this, his sister promptly volunteered to pay saying she has small change (fare was $20+).  But the guy again tried to use sophistry and then jump in and say..  Ah..  You got no change..  it's not I don't want to pay, but you no change..  and tried to snatch the money from his Sister, and Mother as well, and told them not to pay me, and they actually fought over this for ""A Few Minutes"" with me sitting there waiting, and the mother eventually distracted the guy, and the sister handed me the fare (Through the back passenger door at the opposite side) and apologized for all the trouble, and I smiled and told her not to worry.  and what happened next shocked me..

And optimistically, I believe if the government react first and medical professionals realise the rabies is no ordinary rabies and after HSA tests the efficacy of the Phalanx vaccine, martial law can be imposed soon enough. I think rabies and the post-infection behaviour is way too different from flu for the government to take it as lightly as we have for Covid.

With martial law, the complete mobilisation of SAF and Home Team with 2 PDF coordinating, military doctrine gets updated in real time for the worse case scenario of large hordes.

Th government also at this point might deploy troops to Johor reservoir to secure water supplies. Or just go with 100% local supply, which will become power intensive.

Which also brings us to key installations especially our power grid. Our oil storage needs to be constantly fed for us to survive as an on-grid city. Potential for water curfews and scheduled islandwide blackouts is very high and likely. And meanwhile we will need to think long-term sources of oil and gas. How is Malaysia and Indonesia coping? Do they still have control over their oil production and how sustainable are their prices?

At a certain point while the army is building coastal defences, schools will probably be based of operations while fields and parks are converted for subsistence living as domestic supply. Urban farming becomes the new normal.

Perhaps seeing what dynamics the federal government and army has with individual states, Johor also imposes martial law and the royal army of Johor works hand-in-hand with SAF to secure water supply for both states. Unfortunately in that period, the knee-jerk reaction of some jingoist politician will be to call for cutting off water supply to Singapore to ensure enough for Johor and Malaysia, exactly as with chicken and other critical food supply.

This premise lies on the radical government reaction towards a hardcore rabies virus compared to a killer flu.

But we'll surely suffer a lot more in a zombie apocalypse if we adopt a ""monitor and adjust accordingly"" approach. And the government in that scenario you drew up will probably not survive very well in sentosa with little or no access to key installations in a zombie-ravaged mainland, so the only logical conclusion is a retake of the mainland.

Unfortunately, courts or prosecutors ask leading questions. Lawyers are not scientists. Psychologists are also not scientists. Neuroscience is more reliable compared to psychology.  

&gt;These results support the assumption that traditional intelligence tests are not appropriately evaluating executive functions. During the 21st century, this relationship between executive functions and general intelligence has remained as a polemic topic (García-Molina et al., 2010; Tirapu Ustárroz, García-Molina, Ríos Lago, &amp; Ardila, 2012; Verdejo-García &amp; Bechara, 2010). García-Molina et al. (2010) reviewed the relationship between intelligence, on the one hand, and working memory and the executive functions construct, on the other; they also reviewed the relationship between intelligence and the prefrontal cortex, as its possible neuroanatomical substrate. The studies that were surveyed present different answers to the question of whether intelligence and the executive functions are one and the same thing. The authors concluded that intelligence and the executive functions are overlapping in some aspects but not in others. Barbey and colleagues (2012) evaluated impairments on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale and Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System in 182 patients with focal brain damage in relation to voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping. Abnormal performance in these tests was observed following damage to a distributed network of left lateralized brain areas (frontal and parietal cortex and white matter association tracts). It has also been pointed out that some executive function tests such as the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test and Verbal Fluency are closely linked to fl uid intelligence; and executive dysfunction observed in some clinical conditions such as Parkinson disease can be interpreted to refl ect a decrease in fl uid intelligence (Roca et al 2012). Noteworthy, some authors (e.g., Ducan et al., 2000) have suggested that general intelligence is clearly related with the lateral prefrontal cortex, exactly the most important brain area involved in reasoning, problem solving, and in general, meta-cognitive (or intellectual) executive functions (Ardila, Bernal, &amp; Rosselli, 2017; Diamond, 2013; Yuan &amp; Raz, 2014)

Source: Psicothema. 2018, v. 30, n. 2; p. 159-164

&gt;The term ‘executive function’ is used as an umbrella for various complex cognitive processes and sub-processes. Most attempts to define executive function resort to a list of examples (such as task-switching, planning, or that other useful umbrella term ‘working memory’), which reflects the fact that executive function is by no means a unitary concept. The neuropsychological literature converges on the view that successful performance on tests of executive function is critically dependent on the frontal cortex; indeed the terms ‘executive function’ and ‘frontal lobe function’ are often used synonymously. However, recent theories have suggested that this view is simplistic and subcortical regions may also be critically involved. Neuropsychological deficits of patients with Parkinson’s disease, for example, suggest that striatal structures play a role in the mediation of executive processes. Advances in neuroimaging have provided the tools for assessing directly the neuronal basis of executive functions. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it appears that these complex processes are subsumed by distributed circuitry rather than discrete structures. A key advantage of the neuroimaging approach is that it has allowed a degree of localisation of different executive components within prefrontal regions, and the simple ‘equivalence’ of frontal lobe function and executive processing has, therefore, undergone a much more sophisticated dissection. Executive functions are compromised in an array of clinical disorders; patients with various neurological and psychiatric complaints, as well as those with trauma to the frontal lobes, exhibit executive deficits. Neuroimaging provides a means for exploring these deficits, as well as developing an understanding of recovery of executive function frequently seen in patients suffering traumatic brain injury or stroke. This chapter considers the nature of executive functions and how neuroimaging techniques have advanced our understanding of these processes, as well as how they are compromised.

Still, Americans died from opioids all the time; most of the time, it is because they switched to street heroin, which there isn't exactly an FDA for it; thus the strength and purity are unknown. One day, they may get something so much stronger than what they are used to and so they die. The argument that high potential for mistake OD make certain drugs unviable is moot since such drugs are already sold illicitly. At least one guy in Singapore already has plan to use Fentanyl.

My argument is more or less against people in other countries who think that adopting a Singaporean strategy will work at all. You can't do this in America since the President will be voted out of office at the least, or there is violent rebellion. China and Vietnam do execute drug dealers, but the police and courts are so easily corrupted that it's pointless. A less corrupted country also use less drugs (at least that's what I think). So even with a relatively less corrupted police force and court system, the enforcement strategy could not stem the tide of drugs; precisely because drug dealers aren't stupid.

I do agree that 3k/year is nothing. However, the CNB is an organisation that eats a budget of 120 millions/year. That's 40k/arrested addict. Well, I don't count the arrested dealer since that number is so hard to find (it's not in the Police force data. Prison data include total drug-related incarcerated prisoner in that year; interestingly). CNB also estimated that they seized a bit over 6.5 million dollars worth of drugs. This estimation is hilarious. They are using the retail price to calculate the ""damage"" done to the syndicates.

Let me give you an example: 1kg of coffee beans, the good stuff, may cost around 60 dollars retail. That 1kg can make 71 double shots of espresso, which may go for ~3.5 dollars. This means 1kg of beans may make ~250 dollars worth of coffee sale. If I break into the local Starbucks and set fire to 1kg of their beans, Starbucks accountant will record a 60 dollars loss (probably much much less; since this is retail price, and good beans too), not 250 dollars. If they were to sue me at court, yes, they would claim that I did 250 dollars worth of damage.

Using the very pessimistic profit margin of coffee sales and apply it to drugs, most likely, the syndicates lost about 1.7 millions.

In CNB defense and it's likely that they will make this claim: they don't have enough ""resources"". I will bet any amount of money that any country's police force will have more traffic police enforcing parking rules, traffic lights, and speeding than drug police. Apparently, we, as a society, have decided that errant parking is a greater threat than drugs. There is a very simple explanation: traffic fines and such raked in 450 millions per year while the CNB spends 120 millions to catch 3k addicts and uncertain number of criminals, and perhaps do 1.6 millions worth of damage to the syndicates.

Another thing you learn from history is resources, even for the life-or-death situation of total war is not limitless. The political masters actually cannot give their generals everything possible for final victory. If you increase the CNB budget by 10 times, yes, they may be able to do ""something""; but hey, who wants to pay that bill?",singapore,1,t1_ekm3cgc

Many ""heroin"" samples seized in places like Canada no longer have heroin in them. They are Fentanyl or Carfentanil plus adulterants. Trafficking pure Fentanyl and Carfentanil are much easier than heroin. They are available from notoriously poorly regulated chemical manufacturers in pure forms. a tiny vial the size of a thumb can contain several grams of them, enough for hundreds of thousands of doses. This vial can be shoved into any crevices anywhere. Once ashore, can simply be mixed into adulterants to make the end product easier to use. The problem would be how to open the vial and start mixing without spreading it through the air, instantly OD anyone breathing it. A drug dealer dropping a vial of Carfentanil in his flat or in the middle of the airport might as well end up conducting a major chemical terroristic attack.

This brings me to your Darwinism point. I perfectly agree with the concept, you crack down harder, they make themselves harder to crack down. HOWEVER, this is very theoretical. I do not think that syndicates are evolving that much. These are not superintelligent villains. If they wanted to earn money, there are much easier ways to earn much more money (this is also where I will bring in about the importance of social mobility and in singapore, our education system is pretty enabling, not the most optimal but doesnt fix the economic status of the financially disadvantaged, either). We dismantle 30 syndicates a year. A few more will pop up in the next year, made up of a few small groups of people looking to make some quick bucks probably using similar modus operandi, but not at that level to outwit CNB for an extended period of time. Sure, some will be stronger, but eventually they will still get caught. If it becomes so powerful that it dominates the market, someone will definitely give them away at some point in time and lead to their downfall. So again, you might be having giant syndicates in mind, but really Singapore is not that attractive a place for them to invest in because we are just so small and anti-drug. We simply do not have the market for them to flourish.

&amp;#x200B;

Also to add on, CNB is not stupid. It is a small organisation, but it is well structured and funded. There's enforcement divisions, public education divisions and importantly research divisions. There are people in there whose jobs are to keep the agency up to date on the latest drug trends around the world, and you bet they know theres an opoid epidemic in the US. You argue so much about heroin, but I didnt see you mentioning in your post that the number of heroin cases just plummeted in recent years, sharply overtaken by meth. And hence you see the logical turn of attention to fight meth abuse these few years. And you yourself say that CNB keep these data up and accessible, so I dont think that CNB is overselling themselves at all. They are doing a good job, and the results show. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I understand your whole analysis is to point out that we should stop telling other countries to follow us. Perhaps that is true, perhaps our system is only possible because we are so small and easy to govern and enforce these laws. If we bring these laws to a much bigger country, the magnitude of the logistics would be impossible to handle.

- I assume that those countries you're talking about are Scandinavian countries, or some European countries. while it seems like they're much more successful in keeping their countries safe (from drugs), I think their geographical location plays a huge role. compare their neighbours to ours; theirs are mostly first world countries while ours are less developed. this means that drug trafficking around our area is way, way more prevalent. we need a death penalty in place to deter these people

- unfortunately, what can you do about it? it's the citizens of other countries, so what happens to them to be that desperate is out of our control. while we want to show more empathy to these people, you must realise that we're treating our own citizens unfairly. as long as there is one case where we treat the offender less harshly, I'll bet that there will be an increase in the number of drug trafficking cases, because people will try to exploit the justice system, and point to that particular case and call it out, claiming that they were treated unfairly. this means that our citizens are the ones that may suffer because ultimately, we may not catch every single case

- unfortunately, there is nothing much we can do about it either. we can't tell what another country's government what to do. hence, we have to make it clear that if you try to smuggle drugs, you'll be hanged

- the comparisons you make are not comparable to each other. smuggling 50g of drugs is a huge offense. it is equivalent to 50-100 doses of drugs, and that can adversely affect whoever takes it, and the people around them. scamming someone, the money can be refunded, you can earn the money back. the government can give assistance. with drugs, however, the government can't fix a broken family. they can't fix one's health, either

Question 1 and 2 has no bearing on 3 because the law was in force at the point that he committed the crime. Even if later on we decide that such crimes no longer warrant capital punishment, or even no longer should be considered crimes, just as a new law cannot apply retroactively to past actions, a newly repealed law cannot retroactively apply to past actions.

Just got back so looking at the Misuse of Drug Act Section 5

[https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/MDA1973?ProvIds=P12-#pr5-](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/MDA1973?ProvIds=P12-#pr5-)

&gt;Trafficking in controlled drugs

5.—(1)  Except as authorised by this Act, it shall be an offence for a person, on his or her own behalf or on behalf of any other person, whether or not that other person is in Singapore —

(a)	to traffic in a controlled drug;

(b)	to offer to traffic in a controlled drug; or

(c)	to do or offer to do any act preparatory to or for the purpose of trafficking in a controlled drug.

(2)  For the purposes of this Act, a person commits the offence of trafficking in a controlled drug if he or she has in his or her possession that drug for the purpose of trafficking.

Under Section 2 Interpertation

[https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/MDA1973?ProvIds=P11-#pr2-](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/MDA1973?ProvIds=P11-#pr2-)

&gt;“traffic” means —

(a)	to sell, give, administer, transport, send, deliver or distribute; or

(b)	to offer to do anything mentioned in paragraph (a),

otherwise than under the authority of this Act, and “trafficking” has a corresponding meaning;

So, I guess everyone is right. Law specifically states to ""Traffic In"" so moving and handing of cannabis outside of Singapore is not illegal.

All punishment are based on the Second Schedule of the Act[https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/MDA1973?ProvIds=Sc2-#Sc2-](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/MDA1973?ProvIds=Sc2-#Sc2-)

Basically all public prosecutors follow these lines of code

Under Section 8A

&gt;[https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/MDA1973?ProvIds=P12-#pr8A-](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/MDA1973?ProvIds=P12-#pr8A-)  
&gt;  
&gt;8A.—(1)  Section 8(b) has effect in relation to a person who is a citizen of Singapore or a permanent resident of Singapore outside as well as within Singapore where he or she is found as a result of urine tests conducted under section 31(4)(b) to have smoked, administered to himself or herself or otherwise consumed a controlled drug or a specified drug.  
&gt;  
&gt;(2)  Where an offence under section 8(b) is committed by a person mentioned in subsection (1) in any place outside Singapore, he or she may be dealt with as if that offence had been committed within Singapore.

So Joseph Schooling, even if being handled by MINDEF, did break Misuse of Drug Act Section 8A. But why isn't Public Prosecutor going after him?

The verdict is still not out for this. But more importantly, this claim of ""inconsistency"" by abolitionists makes absolutely no sense.

The government has been increasing restrictions on alcohol and tobacco over the years. I personally would like both of them to be banned entirely. The problem here is that tobacco and alcohol are already in Singapore --- both physically and culturally, and it will take a long time for attitudes to shift. It's already tough enough to regulate both of these, why add one more to the list? More concretely, what does Singapore stand to gain from that? Branson's blessings?

Deterrence. We can have endless academic debates on whether it works ""in principle"". But the fact is that Singapore actively sought to stamp out drug problems in the 70s-90s, and the death penalty was a major part of that push. Meanwhile, Europe (yes, even the fabled Portugal) and the US chose to cave into to activists and special interest groups, feebly pussyfooting around with half measures. The results speak for itself.

1. they made a deliberate choice knowing full well the consequences
2. that choice was made out of pure greed

now some people will argue they do it out of desperation because they have no other alternative. I don't buy that at all. firstly, many people in poverty do not resort to crime. secondly, even if you do have to resort to crime there are many other crimes that do not carry the death penalty like shoplifting, loansharking, money laundering etc. they choose drug trafficking because it carries the biggest reward far over and above what is required to survive. so I don't shed many tears when their gamble does not pay off.

another common argument is that the death penalty is irreversible, and there is always the possibility of wrong verdicts. to this I would say that doesn't undermine the death penalty at least in principle. moreover, the death penalty is no more irreversible than 20 years in prison. you can't give that person 20 years of their life back. yet we still accept the risk and continue to sentence people to decades in prison.

What ignorance on the part of MHA! Opium was legal in China during the Ming dynasty long before the British even came to the region. It was only banned by the Qing in 1729 but the ban was ignored by almost everyone. The British may have sold opium to Chinese merchants in Canton but it was Chinese merchants, couriers and smugglers that distributed them all the way to Shaanxi, Mongolia and the northern edges of the empire.

Opium was not illegal in any other country in the 19th century and every country imported opium. Opium tincture was sold freely over the counter in Europe for pain relief. Even children could buy it.

Don't do it the US way. Do it the [Portugal way](https://time.com/longform/portugal-drug-use-decriminalization/) where they have immense success by decriminalizing the consumption of *all* drugs for the end users.  
   
They took all the money they saved from persecuting and imprisoning addicts and put them all into harm reduction.  
  
Addicts can exchange needles at 24 hour stands. Get their drugs tested for free. They even have specially built places for addicts to take their drugs under supervision of healthcare professionals.  

It gave many addicts who made a wrong choice in life a chance to right that wrong. No slums. No needles on the streets. No piss. No shit. The addicts are all properly taken care of and given showers and even a place to sleep.
  
They started this in 2001. It's been 20 years. So where's Portugal now?  
  
The country isn't swarmed with addicts and slums but they didn't reduce the number of addicts either. It stayed the same.  
  
[Most importantly, they now have the lowest death rates in Europe. an almost 50% increment in people seeking help for their addiction since it's no longer a crime.](https://transformdrugs.org/blog/drug-decriminalisation-in-portugal-setting-the-record-straight)  
  
The number of people in prison for drugs also dropped significantly. Rather than coming out of prison as an ex convict and be a burden to society, ex addicts can now receive free treatment, recover, reintegrate into society and start paying some taxes.   
  
In the end, it saved Portugal a lot of money but most importantly, a lot of lives. 

And they did it simply because they chose to change their mindset from ""I'm gonna stop them and scare the rest"" to ""I need to save the lives of these addicts.""

  
There is a reason why this is not known by more people despite Portugal doing it for more than 20 years. And I think the reason is pretty obvious. No one wants to report on it in their own country.",singapore,17,t1_inu37bh

If someone steals, should they get their assets taken away? If someone kills, should they be killed? If someone rapes, should they have their dicks cut off? 

The reason we try not to be punitive is that it doesn't achieve anything in the long run. The issues behind crime are mainly at the systemic level. We try to be rehabilitative because, if crime is still committed despite the systemic factors being good, then they would likely be due to individual level factors, that we should attempt to correct.

But that isn't the case. For example, there's a strong correlation between SES and crime. If we're punitive, we're basically punishing people for being poor.

I think my response to this would be that our current regime rarely catches the drug operators at the top who are actually profiteering. We usually end up catching the drug runners at the bottom. Many of these runners are poor, low educated, low IQ, or might even be addicted to drugs themselves. 

From the perspective proportionality, supposing we catch some Cambodian drug lord. Despite ruining thousands times the amount of lives than a drug runner, our system is unable to offer a more serious punishment. We will execute both. This is so oddly disproportionate, it is almost akin to the Allies giving Hitler and Nazi foot soldiers the same punishment.

Additionally, drug traffickers may be dangerous, but it is not down to the*individual* drug trafficker who is sentenced to death. Often (like in Nagaenthran's case), they are just pawns for larger trafficking networks and empires, and are often subject to coercion, manipulation &amp; exploitation from these networks themselves, desperate to find some form of resolution to a problem they're facing (like Nagaenthran's father's surgery, for example, and when looking at court records, testimony that someone allegedly threatened Nagaenthran as well).

Don't ask for their consent, not that we can truly even speak to dogs and not that dogs understand the situation they are in.

""Disneyland with the Death Penalty"" is a 4,500-word article about Singapore written by William Gibson. His first major piece of non-fiction, it was first published as the cover story for Wired magazine's September/October 1993 issue (1.4).The article follows Gibson's observations of the architecture, phenomenology and culture of Singapore, and the clean, bland and conformist impression the city-state conveys during his stay. Its title and central metaphor—Singapore as Disneyland with the death penalty—is a reference to the authoritarian artifice the author perceives the city-state to be. Singapore, Gibson details, is lacking any sense of creativity or authenticity, absent of any indication of its history or underground culture.

Rape is an iffy thing until there is a definite way of defining consent when there can be so much misinformation on either side.

In other words, he's worried the rule of law in Singapore is a sham, and that the death penalty is catching low level mules so what's the point of killing them, there are plenty more mules who can be coerced...

It is not rehabilitative or reformative justice, but retributive ""justice"". There are also studies which show that the death penalty isn't more effective a deterrent than life imprisonment. Anecdotally, how effective is it really if it can't prevent underprivileged and mentally challenged minorities from being manipulated to commit drug offences? And even for the most severe and heinous of crimes like murder, what good does killing the offender do? It doesn't bring back the dead. Two wrongs doesn't make a right. On practical grounds, making the offender work and serve society during and after their sentence and rehabilitation would be good for society. What is the utility of a dead man? And if the goal is to punish offenders and remove ""undesirables"" from larger society, life imprisonment meets that need. And prisoners can be made to work while serving time. On moral grounds, nobody should have the power to determine who gets to live or die. Nobody is moral arbiter over another's life. The death penalty is not morally or ethically justifiable from either a utilitarian or deontological perspective. Lastly, in the case of wrongful convictions, a wrongly hanged dead man cannot be brought back to life when fresh evidence surfaces; there is no course for remedy.


Then we come to Singapore's weird position on drugs: alcohol is legal and readily available but people are hanged for the mere possession of cannabis, when alcohol is the more dangerous drug, by a long mile, by every conceivable metric.

While it is illegal, the price goes up and therefore supply-side violence as gangs try to cash in on the ""easy money"". The quality goes down because there is great benefit from cutting the product down with something. The users that fall into the stealing and using a knife because of the difficulty of getting the drug, plus the medical problems are mostly caused by that poor quality product. Prostitution is another negative outcome.  
  
Now look at it another way:  
For users, drugs are available at a much cheaper price and of known quality with nothing in it that will make you sick. Needles are not reused so disease risk is drastically reduced. Medical opiates are a clear proof that you can have a clean product sold through a legal supply chain. In most countries where decimalisation has been trialled the stories you speak about are just not there and have actually done the opposite of what you are saying. Adding a regulated supply removes nearly all problems (illegal supply is still investigated and prosecuted)  
  
Decriminalisation also isn’t what most people think of. It means it is not a criminal offence to have the drug for personal use. It does not make it legal to sell or distribute and   
  
Basically, the societal cost of drugs being illegal is considered far higher than the societal cost of decriminalisation. The mention of “junkies on the street” is more a product of homelessness than of the drugs.  A major precursor of drug addiction is actually the lack of belonging, of which homelessness is a highly visible 

""Now relax the law allowing more drug traffickers to test the border security."" - Nobody has ever, in any country, suggested relaxing trafficing laws so your strawman is a blatent attempt at misdirection.

I lean to the side that we shouldn’t put people to death. How sure are we that the process of prosecution is fair when there is little transparency when it comes to hanging cases in Singapore? We spend so much money on drug education and yet there’s still so much consumption. How many kg of cannabis seized every other day? With demand, comes supply. 

I don’t think vaping gets such a tough penalty but I still see it the same as harder drugs like cannabis and ice. Look around and see how common it is to see people vaping these days.

The government has been sending a warning to those who traffick drugs that you will face a death penalty when caught with a certain threshold amount. 

Does that deter traffickers? That is a moot point because if it does, then this latest incident wouldn't happen. I am reminded of a hokkien saying: Money-losing business nobody want, but 'tai tow' (cut-head) venture, people dare. 

In Singapore, you are presumed quilty when caught and the onus is on you to prove otherwise, not the other way round. According to this latest news, he was found quilty and sentenced to death, based on circumstantial evidence and finger-pointing by others. It can be argued that some finger-pointers do so to escape culpability, while others have their own agenda why they do so. Is that right? Again, this a moot point. In my view, he should be jailed long term rather than be hanged to death...

It also states that a survey result shows that a majority of Singaporeans support the death penalty. I say, keep it but don't be so trigger-happy by making it a mandatory penalty. Instead, give the presiding judges the discretion to make that call based on real evidence....",SingaporeRaw,3,t1_jhk151x

What many of us here in the U.S. do want is control of large numbers of street people and homeless, many men of prime working age 18 - 40, who commandeer public spaces in the best parts of cities, drinking, using drugs and causing chronic disorder.

Many of our cities have tried to  get these people to moves to city outskirts/industrial areas, where their behavior will be less bothersome, but we largely fail.  The courts protect the right of these people to occupy important public spaces, and in some cities, police have stopped most drug and public order enforcement.

She was originally in line for the death penalty when she faced two charges of third-degree murder for the two deaths, which became known as the “Bukit Merah double murders” in Singapore. Subsequently, Sundarti, who claimed to be abused by her late employer prior to the killings, was convicted of lesser charges of culpable homicide not amounting to murder and sentenced to life imprisonment in Singapore.

Its a no brainer that he was involved in corruption but then again EVERYONE was. I always thought it was suspicious he got super rich after he started business in China. Family called him 'blessed' but being the cynical fuck that I am, I knew something was fishy. FYI, if you wanted to do business in China at the higher levels, you are almost required to bribe someone in order to expedite papers or what not. That is the way it was before XJP believe it or not. 

Also, speaking of this. You heard of Malaysian Kopi money? Its pretty normalized how Singaporeans would 'pay' Malaysian traffic police to turn the other cheek or shoo them away with small tokens like 50 or 100 ringgit. This is normal behavior, everyone knows about this. But its illegal as fuck obviously. However, if one day you face an honest cop and he arrests you for corruption and you become the fall guy for the police force to use to showcase their vigilance, are you truly at fault here? 

Anyway, he got a trial and everything, MFA involved for counsel and stuff. Family even visited him in prison, he was not mistreated and didn't look starved or whatever. We think its because hes Singaporean so the authorities treat him better to show face. 

China is not that dystopian as reddit would want you to believe. However in this case, their drug penalty laws seem to be similar to SGs. If you're caught with drugs in SG, you're fucked. Why are we crying mother father now that China does the same to one of our own?",singapore,81,t1_gg42b5w

5. Unlike other countries who abuse the capital punishment to attack opposition members, Singapore is the best and most fair when it comes to applying the death sentence.

This was my own personal belief at the start, but the Singapore courts have slipped up time and time again. From prison officials sending confidential lawyer-client information to the prosecution to intentionally informing family as late 1 week before to make the chance for appeals/clemency harder to obtain.

[https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/mha-review-process-notifying-clemency-outcome-execution-death-870456](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/mha-review-process-notifying-clemency-outcome-execution-death-870456)

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/13-prisoners-file-civil-case-against-ag-over-forwarded-personal-letters](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/13-prisoners-file-civil-case-against-ag-over-forwarded-personal-letters)

&amp;#x200B;

Note: the above link has the Court of Appeal openly admitting what the prosecution was wrong. Lawyer-client confidentiality is extremely important for the pursuit of justice.

&amp;#x200B;

The courts stating that it was an oversight rather than an attempt to gain an advantage is a common excuse among judges. Many are afraid to “rock the boat” and thus judges are conservative with their judgements and will find any excuse to protect themselves. Which is unsurprising as the prime minister gets to choose his judges with the president approving them (which btw the means jack shit as the president is a ceremonial role more than an administrative one.)

&amp;#x200B;

6. A positive, Singapore introduced new legislation that made it possible for judges to apply discretion to death sentences to have them reduced to life imprisonment per s 33B of the Misuse of Drugs act. However, the test for getting a life sentence is vague and discretion has been used irregularly.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/MDA1973?ProvIds=pr33B-](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/MDA1973?ProvIds=pr33B-) s 33B

&amp;#x200B;

Case where even the accused is able to prove he had no knowledge of the drugs still attracted the death sentence.

&amp;#x200B;

Gopu Jaya Raman v PP \[2018\] SGCA 9, \[2018\] 1 SLR 499 - In this case there was multiple evidence that the accused did not know of the contents of the bike (his DNA was on none of the packages, text messages show the supplier accepting blame, CNB officers agreeing that it was unlikely the accused knew of the drugs. the accused was further candid and cooperative with the police.He was sentenced to death anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

7. This part is more of an emotional appeal rather than factual. But if you read the stories about how death row inmates are treated and the suffering the family goes through (people who did nothing wrong) you will get a better idea about how cruel death row can be. Poor conditions, solitary confinement for decades will destroy anyone mentally and physically.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.freemalaysiatoday.co](https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/opinion/2022/04/26/singapores-harsh-death-row-conditions-need-overhaul/)[m/category/opinion/2022/04/26/singapores-harsh-death-row-conditions-need-overhaul/](https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/opinion/2022/04/26/singapores-harsh-death-row-conditions-need-overhaul/)

And this may include people who are innocent of their crimes. criminal or no it reflects badly on us as a society that inhumane treatment is ""justice"".

8. Singapore's low drug rates show that the death penalty is working

This argument is one often made by our politicians in favour of capital punishment

[https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-zero-tolerance-drugs-un-narcotics-2574566](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-zero-tolerance-drugs-un-narcotics-2574566)

But the truth is Singapore like most countries with capital punishment, do not release very much information about those on death row, further, statistics on drugs are only given by the Singapore Government itself with no independent investigator allowed to survey Singapore.

[https://theconversation.com/trump-take-note-why-singapores-claim-that-the-death-penalty-works-for-drug-offences-is-fake-news-92305](https://theconversation.com/trump-take-note-why-singapores-claim-that-the-death-penalty-works-for-drug-offences-is-fake-news-92305)

Conclusion

I can still understand the need for capital punishments. Singapore definitely is one of the more fair countries compared to others (read Atefah Sahaaleha girl who was raped, sentenced and publicly hanged in a week.) For now it is an unfortunate necessity. But Singapore should lead by example, they should be making sure the procedure for capital punishment is reserved only for the worst criminals and considerations should be made to those who may not have the proper capacity to understand their actions.As a final note, I think Singapore has made great strides in helping criminals become productive members of society. Recidivism (people re-offending) rates in Singapore are very low at 20%

[https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/reoffending-by-recently-released-inmates-in-spore-at-lowest-point-in-30-years](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/reoffending-by-recently-released-inmates-in-spore-at-lowest-point-in-30-years)

Singapore is great in many ways. But I believe people should at least be educated about the situation surrounding drugs before making a quick judgement. I do not support drugs coming into the country but I believe there are better solutions than capital punishment. I will confess I do not know what they are but I would be satisfied if the Singapore government continues to keep up with new information and make educated decisions on them.

Finally, I think the biggest issue with drugs in Singapore is that people think drug abusers ""deserve"" to be punished. but the truth is drug abuse is a SYMPTOM of a stressed society where those who cannot cope with life find an escape. this video explains it pretty well

Look, it is clear which direction the wind is blowing. Weed legalization is going to spread, and very soon all the major western nations are going to do it (or have done it already). People from those countries are going to be addicts, the same way we are addicted to cigarettes, caffeine or alcohol. Eventually they will see it as harmless and our laws as insane. In fact many already do.

If we do not legalize, then eventually some high-profile American is probably going to be caught with it - say a celebrity or a CEO. We'll have to execute him. This will cause a massive scandal in the American media, people will boycott our island and companies will cancel us like mad. Tourism from western countries will take a huge blow.

Or maybe not. Maybe the SG govt will cover it up. But this sort of thing will undermine the ban. People will notice rich foreigners carting in weed and smoking it. Then the SG govt will have to make an example. The response will be muted, but instead our island will face competition from less restrictive countries who will edge out our dominance as a result.

Consider this: how likely are you to visit (or work in) a country run by, say Jehovah's Witnesses that bans coffee? How many friends do you know that will never, ever go to a country that bans booze? That attitude is what will happen to us. You might say, ""Fuck em we don't want those addicts here"", but right now the USA is in the infancy of weed legalization and they already comprise like 18% of US adults, and that number is growing. That's going to translate to a lot of other countries. Are you going to ask our country to pass up on 20% and up of western tourists and business? What if that number was closer to 50%, when you consider the effect of losing our memetic top spot to another city?

At that point we will have only two choices: either legalize weed or prepare to align with China (who will probably continue to ban weed). I suspect we'd rather keep the wealth inflow from both superpowers. There is a memetic advantage to being #1 in the region, because the gap in money between #1 and #2 is huge.

EDIT: Actually I think I ought to, for the sake of clarity, declare my own biases on the matter. I am in favor of continued prohibition (banning) of drugs but am strongly against the death penalty in any form. I absolutely despise the smell of weed - I have encountered it before and it seriously smelled like BURNT FARTS - and the ridiculous weed culture in the west, but I am very pragmatic about the long-term effects on our country compared to the relatively minor social costs of *weed specifically*.

Long drop hanging usually breaks the neck and causes instant death. Should the neck fail to break, the rope would then suffocate them to death by depriving oxygen to the brain, the brain will then shutdown and cease activity with death coming shortly after. Compared to electric chairs and lethal injections, hanging is relatively clean and the only thing the state has to deal with is the last breath when the offender is unhooked from the rope. Electric chairs cause a great deal of suffering and the aftermath is relatively messy with tissues and fluids leaking from all orifices. Lethal dosage is a slow process of dying and as the amount to kill each human may vary, it requires continuous admission of the drug to kill and at times an anaesthetic drug to alleviate the pain.

He was asked, by reference to photographs of the six bundles marked E1 to E6, whom they belonged to. Nowhere did the applicant say that he did not know if E1 to E3 were the bundles that he had collected. The applicant had also proceeded to say that he had divided the fourth big block (or “storybook”) into three smaller bundles. **The Court of Appeal held that this admission was fatal to the applicant’s case**. The applicant’s admission was also corroborated strongly by other facts:

&gt; (a) The very bundles of cannabis that he had admitted to collecting and repacking were precisely what were found in the apartment.

&gt; (b) It was wholly improbable that the remaining three big blocks that the applicant admitted that he had collected had somehow inexplicably gone missing but then were replaced by three other similar blocks that some other person had inexplicably placed there.

Now, believe it or not, the issue with drugs has nothing to do with whatever you think it is. The issue with drugs is all about money - and specifically syndicate money. 

The more liquid and addicting a business is (and the easier it is), it is a gold mine for gangs/syndicates. And what better business keep its customers coming? Hint: drugs and prostitution.

And you can say that 'oh but its not true' and whatever - but take a close look at countries that have loose attitude towards drugs and its crime rates by syndicates (i.e. gang related activities, corruption etc.). 

On a social level, sure drugs ruin family but so does gambling. But the key is syndicates and gangs can use drugs as a gold mine if we dont have such a harsh punishment. 

So then the question is 'if you have lived in a place that is extremely safe, going out in the night doesnt get you involved in gangs or mugged, and your police force can be trusted which wont side with the gangs - will you choose to give up this privilege that has become an entitlement?'.

Most judiciaries are loathe to abnegate their power of determination to psychiatric/psychological or medical experts, since that would undermine their constitutionally defined role as the final arbiter. 

Hence criterion like IQ scores come in as part of evidence to establish the mens rea or any applicable defences, but the fact of a low IQ score is not in itself determinative.

People downvote or upvote based on emotions. I have said death penalty bad in 2 different threads and have received both highly upvoted comments and highly downvoted ones.

I find your comment interesting, and I enjoy engaging with anybody that approaches any topic with goodwill and I wont change your mind either. That being said, I think your attempt at pointing out fallacies has been poor.

\&gt;As mentioned by other users, it is not a fair extrapolation to extendand connect homicide-capital punishment relations to drugtrafficking-capital punishment relations.

Actually, this is a poor argument because it does not engage with my point honestly. At least /u/loveforlandlords has repeatedly tried to understand my point and argued against it. While Drug Trafficking and Murders are different crimes, the underlying factors that drive both are the same. Poor Economic Opportunity, poor social welfare, poor mental healthcare coverage. They are not that same, however, the point that we are contending with are driving factors for crimes. My main idea is that economic, social and healthcare factors are bigger causes for drug trafficking, similar to homicide. The only intellectually honest conversation would be one engaging this main premise.

&gt;SirPalat does ask the very real question- what's the difference betweenSingapore's capital punishment system vs that of the United States?Well, everything? The US's Capital Punishment system differs from stateto state. Crimes are convicted based off jury systems, making the legalsystem more susceptible to smooth talking lawyers and criminally unawarejury members.

I actually never asked that question, I never really talked about the trial process. 

&gt;On the other side of the fence, u/loveforlandlordsmentions the MHA article. Jesus christ, any scientific article outthere needs at least two peer reviews before it can be published

This is not a fair criticism of /u/loverforlandlords 's point. Data for Singaporean judicial system is effectively 0. He is getting the best he could get. This lack of data is exactly what pushes me to use US data for homicide rates and their relation to the death penalty. The lack of data. This is especially frustrating as it is harder to support or refute any point. However, while I do agree that MHA data is highly skewed (wtf 4 years as a sample size when it takes nearly a decade to put someone to death), I would give /u/loverforlandlords the benefit of the doubt. He is arguing in good faith and is taking my constraints into account while you are not.

&gt;The question is, why is it a tragedy?Areall convictions 100% foolproof? Statistically, we can surely say thatat least one person in Singapore's prisons, throughout the entirehistory of time, was wrongly convicted. Does this mean that we discardthe due process and the legal system in pursuit of ensuring that the oneinnocent man is free?

Are you seriously asking why putting someone to death that is innocent is a tragedy? Even the most pro-death penalty people will not even question that stance. It is a tragedy because it is state-sanctioned murder of an innocent man while the guilty are free. Again you are arguing against something I am not arguing for. No conviction is foolproof, there will always be wrongful sentences. Humans are fallible, I understand that, however with imprisonment, you still can salvage the situation by correcting your mistake and letting the man go free with compensation. Not a perfect solution, but it is better than killing someone and go ""oops my bad"". The imperfection of the judicial system is exactly why we should not give any judge the ability or put the judge in the position to make a decision over the life of another human being. I think arguing against something I am not arguing for is the very definition of a strawman fallacy

&gt;If your argument is that the small time criminals are being exploitedby the kingpins, then the question would be- what, realistically, is theright way for a foreign nation to crackdown on drug trade thatpredominately diffuses over from another country?

Ultimately, drug trafficking is an issue that transcends state boundaries and we should tackle it like how we tackle all regional or global issues, through cooperation. That being said locally we can do tons of stuff to make drug trafficking economically not viable. We can help the lower-income or the people without any opportunities to bounce back. As I said before, I believe that drug trafficking is largely driven by economic, social and healthcare factors because the users of drugs are suffering from these factors. Address these issues and there will be a lower demand for drugs. Also, it could be argued that right now drugs laws are overly restrictive in the sense that harmless substances such as Marijuana is overly criminalized. Legalize and regulate harmless drugs and you diminish the strength of drug cartels. This last point is not one that I strongly support but I can see the argument for it.

&gt;Where each state has different laws and the appeal process can beintricate and expensive, which are mainly legal costs and lengthy waittimes. Questions for you guys: 1. Is cost the main factor in determiningculpability? 2. Is it possible to extrapolate a US-based study with avery different legal system to Singapore's own legal system? If cost istruly an issue, then a reform of the legal system is in order to removebulk and wasteful processes.

There is some truth to what you are saying but it ignores the fact that no matter what, life imprisonment is way cheaper than the death penalty. This is not just shown in the US but in the UK(when they had the DP), India, and other commonwealth nations. The reality is that appeals and retrials are expensive no matter the judicial system, while the range of cost might differ, the trend is that Death Penalty is indeed more expensive. The most recent case of Nagaethran has been to at least 6 retrials or appeal hearings since 2009, not including the upcoming one. Even if the cost and appeal process is different from the US, the fact still remains that the process to send someone to death is incredibly expensive as compared to imprisonment.

And no cost is not the main factor. If you notice, most comments on the cost come in response to people saying ""just kill him, its cheaper."". It is trying to remove all plausible support for the death sentence. Nobody campaigning for the abolition of the Death Penalty is motivated by cost-cutting. It is just a pushback against the pragmatists who view this as a cheaper alternative.

Ideally we would not need to use US data to extrapolate to Singapore's context however it is blatantly obvious that this data is not published or perhaps recorded due to the desire to keep the status quo. However, due to a lack of data, we have to extrapolate US data no matter how tenuous. That being said, I don't think it is a useless exercise as the vast majority of people do not realise how costly the appeal process is and this is a good way to show them that things are more complicated than you think it is.  Lastly, cost is not an issue, all this ""wasteful process"" is meant to ensure that the innocent do not die, it is very much necessary and important. The argument is not to make the Death Penalty cheaper, but to illustrate the cost such that the idea that sentencing someone to death is cost-effective is properly refuted. Whether you are convinced or not is another story, but you portrayal of the argument is poor and in bad faith.
