t3,12v9v4i,askSingapore,22/4/2023 15:44,greenfattyavocados,"What are your thoughts on the to-be hanging of Tangaraju Suppiah, a Singaporean convicted for trafficking 1kg of Cannabis - and is there any way it can be stopped?","It was only a few years ago when a lawyer friend shared with me more about the workings of our laws (how judges have no discretion in meting out the death penalty if the accused was found guilty + failed to substantively assist the authorities in disrupting drug trafficking activities) when I found myself questioning our current set of laws. 

Still I was always on the fence - I've read accounts of how damaging drugs like heroin and meth can be, and too read about the opioids crisis in US -, unsure about what stance to take.

But then just yesterday I came across the article that reported about the to-be hanging of Tangaraju Suppiah, a fellow Singaporean who was found guilty of trafficking 1kg of cannabis into Singapore (he was the recipient who offered a Malaysian a job to traffick cannabis from Malaysia into Singapore). 

I guess that really got me riled up due to my knowledge of the drug's extent of harm, the growing decriminalisation and even legalisation across the world, personal encounters with it (I saw many, many foreign friends smoke it overseas without any visible harm) and most importantly my belief that as life is precious, and we ought to reserve capital punishment only for the most serious of cases, if any.

Now, I want to be clear that I'm not advocating for the legalisation/decriminalisation. That is something I still have no opinion of. But what I want to advocate for, at least for now due to urgency (the hanging is in 3 days) is to reclassify cannabis under a less severe class where its trafficking does not yield the mandatory death penalty.

And I'm curious to hear about your thoughts on this matter so I can take it into account while crafting my message. And if you're happen to be a lawyer, I would very much appreciate if you could share - given the current timeline of 3 days to hang - what are the possible avenues, if any, to prevent the hanging from going through along with its likelihood of success.

Thanks,

I've been following the Indonesian executions lately and the actions of the Australian and Brazilian government in the followup and aftermath of the executions.

Just for your information and to provide context for a discussion, although Malaysia and Indonesia both have capital punishment, they have in the past intervened to save the lives of their citizens on foreign death rows (Indonesian paid 'blood money' to Saudi Arabia and Malaysian opposition parties intervened to try and save the life of Yong Wui Kong in Singapore). 

So some of the questions I had thought about regarding this were;

1) If a Singaporean is facing capital punishment elsewhere, would/could/should our government do anything to save that persons life?

2) Do you think, given our national support for capital punishment (95% of all Singaporeans allegedly) and the actions of our ministers (our Law Minister 'justifying' capital punishment to UN audience) that our hands are tied from any diplomatic actions? How much 'clout' do we have?

3) If you hold the view that it's hypocritical to intervene, may I ask you why you hold that view? (Please bear in mind the above example of Indonesia and Malaysia).

t3,bbuoxm,singapore,11/4/2019 2:17,SmirkingImperialist,"Is this analysis of drug enforcement effectiveness data ""potentially misleading""?","As I grow older, I came to the belief that government anywhere does not really know what they are doing. A government's competence has little to do with how it is structured or what law it is enforcing but rather the general level of development and competency of the population (in other words, it's very hard to be a vanguard).

One thing the Singapore government is very proud of, apparently, is the draconian enforcement of criminalisation of certain substances called ""drugs"". The government from top to bottom keep saying the same thing: our effort is great, we don't have as many drug users as other countries. The Singapore ambassador to the US wrote very proudly that Singapore in the Washington post that Singapore managed to reduce the number of drug user arrested from 6000/year in the 90s to ~3000/year in 2017.
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/singapore-is-winning-the-war-on-drugs-says-ambassador-to-us
(Washington Post is behind a paywall)

While what he wrote was technically correct, he conveniently ignored the data in the in the 2002s. No one seems to read the annual report the CNB put out or the data released by CNB, apparently.
https://www.cnb.gov.sg/newsandevents/reports-(overview)
https://data.gov.sg/dataset/demographic-profile-of-drug-abusers

The 2002 report contained data of total number of drug users arrested from 1992 to 2002. The number of drug users arrested did decreased from &gt;6000 in 1992 to ~3300 in 2017. The point of lowest number of drug user arrested was actually in 2005, with 793 arrested that year. The 2005 report was very, very proud of that fact, and it was short. 7 pages long. An equivalent report of the Australian counterparts is 60 pages long.

Then the number started ticking back up. About 2 years later, the number was 2211. The 2007 report is still relatively short, 6 pages long; but it contained only 2006 and 2007 numbers. Then things kinda keep going up; and in 2017, the total arrests of drug users is 3091, the report is 19 pages long, and the draught of data is still the same (just 2016 and 2017 numbers).

The CNB used to release a data set called the street price of major drug of abuse. The price of heroin, according to that data set has crashed straight through the floor. If I ask you to name single legal thing that you can buy in Singapore whose price has decreased in absolute terms in 2017 compared to 2008, you will be very hard pressed. If I expand it into illegal drugs; it's easy. I questioned the CNB over this data and they gave me some very unsatisfactory answers. Then the dataset was taken off data.gov.sg.

In the course of researching this topic, I came across the most useless Master thesis dissertation ever:
https://scholarbank.nus.edu.sg/handle/10635/23099
The dissertation is supposedly an analysis of the CNB's effectiveness as a case study. It spent 80 pages on basically literature reviews of methodology on assessing the effectiveness, Singapore's laws, and the CNB structure and resources. Then the actual part that is directly related to the title, the analysis of the effectiveness, is 10 pages long. A third of that 10 pages are excuses on why certain analysis can't be done. My PhD committee will fail me if my dissertation has that structure.

All of the data I used in in the public domain; some have since been rescinded since I contacted the CNB over my interpretation of it.

So, what happened? We keep reading in the news about the CNB busting kilos of drugs, but one cursory look at the number of judicial execution see an interesting trend:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Singapore
It went down. From 1994-1996, Singapore executed 50-75 people; no doubt a lot of them drug traffickers. This probably contributed to the drop of drug users in the 90s. From the low point of drug users arrested in 2005 to 2017, the number of executed per year remained well under 9 per year. How?

Before I answer that, here's another interesting trend: the purity of heroin in Singapore went from ~50% (sample seized in 80s) to 5% (more recent samples).
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28670869

Think about that for a moment. How can the purity of drugs go down? If your drug is less pure; you need to haul more of it and make yourself easier to be caught. Every other category of drugs, including alcohol during the American Prohibition displayed the trend of increasing purity. Americans went from drinking beers before the Prohibition to 80-proof moonshine. Methamphetamine went from 20-30% pure ""Yaba pills"" in South East Asia to 80-90% pure crystal meth (a lot of which sold by North Korean diplomats). Even cannabis: cannabis growers should receive PhDs for their astounding feats of selective breeding despite very limited equipment. They managed to create strains with ~50% THC (the psychoactive components cannabis), up from the rather low 10-15% of yesteryears.

Here is my interpretation and speculation as why heroin sellers can still sell their stuff and not get executed as oftently recently compared to the 90s. Heroin is still a major drug of abuse in Singapore, btw: about one-third of user arrests are related to heroin. Singapore death penalty are based on the amount of pure substance trafficked. In the case of heroin, it's the amount of pure diamorphine. 15g is the mandatory threshold. What happens for every seizure is the police need to estimate the purity, then calculate from the total amount of heroin no. 3 (low quality) seized to get the pure diamorphine quantity. Basing the penalty on the total pure amount is absolutely vital as far as the law goes since without this, it's hilariously easy to frame someone for a death penalty: throw 2kg of flour mixed with 0.5g of heroin into someone's possession and viola, deadman walking.

When heroin sold and trafficked was 50% pure, getting caught with 30g is a death penalty. More recently, heroin has become less pure; meaning ~300g will be the death penalty. Still heroin is heroin, less pure heroin can't deliver the same high and users won't accept it.  How can the sellers make up the 45% missing ""purity""?

Enter: ultra-potent synthetic opioids. Heroin is ~2x more potent than morphine. Fentanyl is ~100x more potent than morphine and Carfentanil is ~10.000x more potent. Drug mules can traffic 5% heroin and 0.9% fentanyl or 0.009% Carfentanil mixture for the same potency. 15g diamorphine is enough for ~100 average doses (150mg diamorphine/dose). Opioids build tolerance so new users may need ~10-20mg but long-term users may require over 200mg. 30g of heroin no. 3 (the common type of heroin sold) result in death penalty. Now with the new mixture, the death penalty starts at ~300g of 5% pure heroin mixture; and it's enough for 1000 doses instead.

Fentanyl and Carfentanil are Schedule 2 drugs: misuse attracts jail terms but not death penalties. We need them to remain available or a lot of patients will suffer needlessly.

There is an important lesson of war and conflict: when you are fighting other humans, who are intelligent and adapt to your tactics, you will find your tactics fast becoming less and less effective. In a total war, you can go balls-to-the-walls genocidal and ""make a solitude and call it peace"". The civilian society is not a warzone, the population are not partisans and guerrillas (by and large), and the police can not be the Gestapo or NKVD (I hope).

SINGAPORE, April 27 (Reuters) - A Malaysian man convicted of drug trafficking was executed on Wednesday in Singapore despite appeals for clemency on the grounds that he had an intellectual disability, his family said.

Nagaenthran Dharmalingam, 34, had been on death row for more than a decade for trafficking 44 grams (1.5 oz) of heroin into Singapore, which has some of the world's toughest narcotics laws. His lawyers had filed multiple appeals against his execution saying he was intellectually disabled.

His brother Navin Kumar, 22, said by telephone the execution had been carried out and said the body would be sent back to Malaysia where a funeral would be held in the town of Ipoh.

A Singapore court on Tuesday had turned down a legal challenge put forward by Nagaenthran's mother, clearing the way for the execution by hanging.

At the end of Tuesday's hearing, Dharmalingam and his family reached through a gap in a glass screen to grasp each others' hands tightly as they wept. His cries of ""ma"" could be heard around the courtroom. 

About 300 people held a candlelight vigil at a Singapore park on Monday to protest against the planned hanging.

Nagaenthran's case has attracted world attention, with a group of United Nations experts and British billionaire Richard Branson joining Malaysia's prime minister and human rights activists to urge Singapore to commute his death sentence.

His lawyers and activists have said Nagaenthran's IQ was found to be at 69, a level recognised as an intellectual disability. However, the courts determined he knew what he was doing at the time of his crime, and ruled there was no admissible evidence showing any decline in his mental condition.

It was the first in what activists fear is a looming wave of executions and came just a day after a mentally disabled Malaysian man lost his final death sentence appeal.

Abdul Kahar Othman, sentenced to death in 2015, was executed early Wednesday, according to a leading Singaporean campaigner against capital punishment.

""Rest in peace,"" tweeted the activist Kirsten Han.

""We should all be ashamed of what the state did in our names today.""

A member of a support group for people with relatives on death row in Singapore, speaking anonymously, confirmed to AFP the execution had taken place.

She said she was waiting for the body to arrive at a Muslim cemetery. Abdul Kahar was a member of the city-state's Muslim minority.

Singaporean authorities did not respond to requests for confirmation.

In 2019, the last year that Singapore carried out executions, four people were hanged, according to the city-state's prison service.

The prosperous but socially conservative country has some of the world's toughest drugs laws but has faced mounting calls from rights groups to abandon the death penalty.

Authorities insist however that capital punishment remains an effective deterrent against drug trafficking and has helped to keep Singapore one of the safest places in Asia.

According to the Transformative Justice Collective, a Singaporean group that campaigns against the death penalty, 68-year-old Abdul Kahar was convicted of trafficking heroin in 2013 and sentenced to death two years later.

He was first jailed at the age of 18 and spent the rest of his life shuttling in and out of prison on drug-related offences, according to the group.

The United Nations human rights office had on Tuesday urged authorities not to go ahead with the hanging.

""We are concerned at the surge in execution notices this year,"" it said in a tweet.

Nagaenthran K. Dharmalingam, the mentally disabled Malaysian convicted of heroin trafficking, could be hanged in the coming days after losing his final appeal on Tuesday.

His case has attracted a storm of criticism, including from the European Union and British billionaire Richard Branson.

In addition, three other men sentenced to death for drugs offences had their appeals rejected earlier in March.",7,0.6,2,0,2,capital punishment,t3_ts31m4

t3,jmm4i4,singapore,2/11/2020 11:57,MythicalZoan,How strong is public support for the death penalty in Singapore?,"I submitted [this SMU study on 1500 Singapore citizens](https://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4352&amp;context=sol_research) as a link earlier but did not realise such articles also had to conform to the rule on having to use the exact title of the article. 

Many ministers have made the claim that most Singaporeans support the death penalty -- this study adds some nuance to this discussion and provides support that there is questionable support for the death penalty and the mandatory death penalty once people are provided more information about the death penalty itself. 

You can check what questions were posed to the surveyed individuals in the appendix to the article.

Basic Q&amp;A, sourced by me so do doublecheck against the article if you think I am mistaken in my reading of it:

**Who was surveyed?**

&gt;1500 randomly selected Singapore Citizens representative of SG demographic, interview conducted face to face, names and addresses gathered from Singapore Department of Statistics, 76% response rate

**What are the TL;DR findings?**

&gt;If you ask ""do you support death penalty"" 90% of people say yes. If you ask people in more detail, this drops to &lt;50% of people. Even when asked without any detail, less than 50% say they support a mandatory death sentence (Judge has no choice but to impose death penalty despite mitigating circumstances, e.g drug cases)

&gt;Also table 10 in the article which provides that only ~35% of people support the death penalty if it can be proven that some people who were innocent have been executed.

&gt;This article supports the validity of a general set of hypotheses which were found to be generally true in some other countries and originated in America, called the Marshall Hypotheses: 

&gt;&gt; (1) The general public know little about the death penalty.

&gt;&gt;(2) Exposure to information about the death penalty reduced support for it.

&gt;&gt;(3) Retributivists tended to be immune to the effects of information about the death penalty

**Someone asked in the previous thread whether the researchers pose leading questions**

My personal opinion on the question:
&gt;The questions are available for viewing in the appendix

&gt;But IMO they are not leading because it is legitimate to ask for whether death penalty is acceptable in the event that, for example, it is shown that innocent people have been executed. No judiciary or prosecution is perfect, as we are learning with just a couple of recent cases (Portella, Parti Liyani, [Gobi Avedian](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/drug-courier-who-escaped-gallows-last-year-gets-death-penalty-after-court-of)), and not everyone has the resources to repeatedly appeal.

&gt;In any case, if people are so amenable to being led on, doesnt that also tell us how weak people's conviction in the death penalty is?

&gt;And probably the last point to make is that the alternatives here to mandatory death penalty are plentiful --&gt; discretionary death penalty, life imprisonment, etc",93,0.81,43,0,43,death penalty,t3_jmm4i4

So then why should rapists not get the noose as well? The worst thing about rape is that it is a crime that is thought through and an act that you dont have to do. Lets say you are selling drugs, sure there could be circumstances that forces you into that scenario like bills to pay or what not; murder because of that person owes you money. 

How about rape? There is literally no reason for this crime to be committed and yet the culprit did it. And the victim has to live with the scar for the rest of their lives. The kind of scar that prevents them from trusting another person of the same/different gender. They have issues developing romantically or sexually.

Iâ€™m writing my thoughts here.

I understand that for historical reasons and because bad people exist ( drug kingpins will keep trying to make money), the death penalty exists in Singapore. The drug kingpins and middle men will therefore always seek and identify - and also be approached by - people who would be willing or unwilling sellers and mules. 

Are there enough safety nets in Singapore that would help a person push back on being a customer-facing seller/dealer or a mule?

For those that take up such work because it is â€œeasy moneyâ€ - I can think of daunting roadblocks such as:
- think of the people you want to see before you are executed after being caught someday, because you will eventually be caught ( tip off by jealous people, for e.g.)
- build up skills now and you can get honest employment and can also explore doing business.
- being taught the impact of their actions on users ( who themselves need help to understand they should not take drugs in the first place)
- meetings with others already on â€œdeath rowâ€ to get dissuaded ( how to identify those vulnerable)
- other ideas?

For those that take up such work because of coercion or duress:
- what are the things that they can do? (For example: approach police or some NGO)
- safer alternatives to loan sharks ( are there any?)
- how to deal with blackmail ( e.g if their personal pics and videos fall in othersâ€™ hands, then how to disclose parents or family and deal with the first wave of anger and ridicule them them).

Have such discussions happened in Singapore?

Are there organisations or ministries that think about and identify and help those who have slipped through support nets?

How would a person who feels helpless know whom to approach and what to tell?

I realise also that reducing the demand for drugs is another approach, but there would be the bored people who need something new. I havenâ€™t thought that through.

This is all that Iâ€™m capable of thinking of. There are much smarter people than me in this sub and in Singapore. I would like to learn their thoughts.

t3,6wh434,singapore,28/8/2017 4:19,mee_sua,"Ask not what Tony Tan has done as President, but what he could have done as President","There's been much praise for Tony Tan in the top post on the front page. I don't wish to debate those points which are mostly true, but I feel Singaporeans are being once again misled by a false dichotomy: Either Tony Tan is KFC uncle, or he is a great President who has served the people well. The truth is always more complicated than the various accolades and memes mentioned in the other thread. 

When we ask the question of whether Tony Tan has served the people well as President, we must not stop at asking whether he has performed his official duties or not. That clearly goes without saying. You do not praise someone for performing his perfunctory obligations. The precedent set by SR Nathan and presidents before him, such as charity work and diplomatic duties, is well established. 

It is a strawman to allege that critics are saying Tony Tan collects millions of dollars every year for doing nothing at all. Critics simply think TT does not deserve that salary for carrying out his Presidential duties as a PAP ""yes man"". And I'm pretty sure nobody would dare to whisper ""KFC"" within his earshot unless it's to announce his 2pc meal is ready.

The Presidency has been seen by the people as a means of a check on the ruling government's power. In fact, LKY himself created the EP in response to the minor electoral setbacks encountered by the PAP in the 80's; should a ""freak election"" occur, the President (presumably a PAP man) will block an opposition party from frittering away the monetary reserves built up by PAP. Yet this would prove to be a double edged sword, for a independent minded President (like Ong) could create a headache for PAP.

In the first PE, Chua Kim Yeow, a complete political nobody, managed to gather more than 40% of the vote share despite doing zero serious campaigning, even going so far as to declare opponent Ong Teng Cheong the better candidate on national TV. In the latest PE, more than 60% of the vote share went to non-establishment candidates. 

The PAP's popularity in general elections does not translate to the PE because people don't want an establishment figure who does not provide a check and balance. Ong Teng Cheong is fondly remembered for this reason despite being a PAP man.

So now this is the point of contention: Has Tony Tan provided a check and balance, fulfilled his ombudsman role adequately, providing an alternative voice against potential misuse of power? Has he done more than SR Nathan, or even Ong Teng Cheong in this regard? 

If you think the death penalty in Singapore is unnecessarily harsh, especially when inflicted on desperate, unwitting drug mules, do note that the last time a death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment was in 1998 by Ong Teng Cheong.

If you think that the Prime Minister's personal lawyer should not have been made Attorney General given his age and the clear conflict of interest, note that the President has the power to refuse appointment to key office holders in government.

If you think that social spending should be increased, for example subsidising healthy foods instead of pushing the blame on low income Singaporeans for not eating healthy, note that the President does have the power to approve/deny withdrawal from the reserves to combat health crises like this.

If you think ISA can be abused against political enemies, note that the President can block ISA arrests.

If you think there needs to be more transparency about the management of finances by government, note that the President is ""entitled to request information about the Government which is available to the Cabinet, and about the statutory boards and Government companies""(from wiki page on presidential powers).

If you think that the Constitution should not be able to be amended with impunity by one party with a supermajority in Parliament to suit their political ends, note that the President, under specific conditions, may block amendments to the Constitution.








There's also a lot of one sided praise for Tony Tan in his various Ministerial roles, and I shan't turn this post into a list of all his missteps, because even scholar elites make honest mistakes. It's also pretty easy to find lots of valid criticism about Tony Tan with some brief googling. But Tony Tan portrayed as a man of the people is something I would not wholeheartedly agree with. [His stance on union disputes for one revealed his priorities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Tan#Union_disputes_and_conflict_with_Ong_Teng_Cheong). The comment in the other thread also brings up the billions lost by GIC in their UBS investment, but does not mention [TT was executive director of GIC](http://www.theindependent.sg/gic-refuses-to-disclose-exact-losses-in-ubs-investment-sporeans-left-speculating/) when they purchased their stake in UBS. 


From what little I have read of Tony Tan, he comes across as a dyed in the wool PAP man through and through - a conservative politician who did not dissent from the majority opinion of his colleagues. Opposing LKY's GMS scheme is not some maverick, man of the people move by TT as many of his colleagues could also see  plain as day, that blatant eugenics was a bad idea and openly opposed it. More importantly, the comment in the other post fails to mention the public backlash towards GMS in the 1984 elections that saw  PAP receiving their lowest share of votes since 1965, which led to the policy being scrapped. Along with several of the PAP old guard, TT also opposed the construction of the IRs for the same reasons(erosion of family core) that LKY had resisted building casinos in Singapore for decades. 

In short, TT displayed the kind of proven loyalty that the establishment expects from their man in the hotseat, which SR Nathan as a career civil servant who benefited from LKY's patronage and Halimah as Speaker of Parliament also displayed.



I encourage people not to take my word for it, or anyone's words on this subreddit for that matter. Do your own research to look past the half truths and convenient omission of critical details. Although I suspect many of us have better things to do, it's not too difficult to look up the answers to this question: **Why the Elected Presidency matters**.

Murder is murder. It is not rehabilitative or reformative justice, but retributive ""justice"". There are also studies which show that the death penalty isn't more effective a deterrent than life imprisonment. Anecdotally, how effective is it really if it can't prevent underprivileged and mentally challenged minorities from being manipulated to commit drug offences? And even for the most severe and heinous of crimes like murder, what good does killing the offender do? It doesn't bring back the dead. Two wrongs doesn't make a right. On practical grounds, making the offender work and serve society during and after their sentence and rehabilitation would be good for society. What is the utility of a dead man? And if the goal is to punish offenders and remove ""undesirables"" from larger society, life imprisonment meets that need. And prisoners can be made to work while serving time. On moral grounds, nobody should have the power to determine who gets to live or die. Nobody is moral arbiter over another's life. The death penalty is not morally or ethically justifiable from either a utilitarian or deontological perspective. Lastly, in the case of wrongful convictions, a wrongly hanged dead man cannot be brought back to life when fresh evidence surfaces; there is no course for remedy.


Then we come to Singapore's weird position on drugs: alcohol is legal and readily available but people are hanged for the mere possession of cannabis, when alcohol is the more dangerous drug, by a long mile, by every conceivable metric. Drug traffickers are merely filling a void in the market: no demand, no supply. At least drug users voluntarily ask for drugs, rape victims don't ask to be raped.

IMHO just like how 377A is unlikely to be abolished, same for the govt stance on a zero-tolerance for drugs. SG would be executing 4 more men next week, and all for drug offenses. 

It is perhaps high time for us to consider other ways to save these people from execution. If you look at most of  people being hanged, they come from low-income families and are almost always drug-users themselves. They have been incarcerated multiple times and are repeat offenders.

Most if not all of them regret abusing drugs like Heroin but are unable to ditch the habit totally. We have to all acknowledge how powerful these substances are and their cruel hold on their lives. SG along with some Muslim charitable organisers have very good half-way houses that help these re-offenders, however they are still at risk.

What could potentially work is for a charitable organisation to raise money so that we can move these offenders to Portugal for a long period of time while they work to recover fully (Addiction is a disease). The reason why I mention Portugal is because it is one of the countries in the world where All drugs have been legalised (including heroin). This would allow these re-offenders to recuperate without the threat of death.

A few days ago I came across an article that shared about the to-be hanging of 46-year-old Singaporean Tangaraju Suppiah scheduled on the 26 April for the trafficking of 1.017kg of cannabis, a drug which many, many countries and experts across the world (and myself) agree that the extent of harm does not warrant the most serious of punishments, the death penalty.

For the most part, I think I'm a pretty easygoing person.

But as I read the article, I found myself, as one who believed in the sanctity of life, in the principles of justice, rehabilitation, and compassion, feeling upset, and felt that this is a decision we as a country will regret years down the road when we look back.

I know that there is probably little that can be done given the time constraints and legal frameworks in which I'm not trained, but I still - given my knowledge and experiences surrounding cannabis and the new research being conducted around it - felt it was only right for me to at least try to speak out in my capacity as a Singaporean in hopes of possibly saving Tangaraju Suppiah's life, as wishful as that may be.

The article can be viewed here: &lt;link in the comments&gt;

Summary of writing (tl;dr):

* The majority of Singaporeans (73.7%) agree that the death penalty should be used for the most serious crimes - I argue that he harms of cannabis abuse is not severe enough to both the abuser and society such that cannabis trafficking does fall under â€œthe most serious crimesâ€ 
* Only 7 out of 195 countries have the mandatory death penalty for cannabis trafficking
* Drug (cannabis being an example) classifications across the world are based on unreliable and scientifically dubious schedules. In Jan 19, WHO recommended the UN to update the scope of cannabis based on the increased use of cannabis and its components for medical purposes, the emergence of new cannabis-related pharmaceutical preparations for therapeutic use, and that cannabis had never been subject to a formal pre-review or critical review by the ECDD.
* On Dec 20, the UN The[ UN commission voted 27 - 25 to remove cannabis](https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/12/1079132) (although it still considers it harmful and remains in Schedule I) from its list of Schedule IV drugs.
* Experts support this view. 3 different studies conducted have all consistently ranked the harms of cannabis significantly lower than alcohol, and very close to tobacco. 
* I then explore the harms of cannabis based on CNBâ€™s information booklet, and argue that the extent of harms are not severe enough to both the abuser and society such that cannabis trafficking falls under â€œthe most serious crimesâ€
* I extract some of Ministerâ€™s Shanmugamâ€™s statements about the role of death penalty in Singapore and share my viewpoints on why they are not valid in cannabis trafficking related cases like Â Tangaraju Suppiahâ€™s.
* I conclude by summarising the article, as well as share about the status quo bias that we humans have, which may cloud our judgements

Would appreciate it if you take some time out of your day to read it, and if you think that my points are valid to some extent, send this message to the PM/the President/People in positions of power so our laws can be improved (if need be), as well as to possibly give a fellow Singaporean a second chance in life.

Lastly, I want to add that the writing was completed in quite a hurry due to Tangaraju Suppiah's hanging being only 2 days away. If you find yourself disagreeing or have spotted gaps in my points - which is of course completely acceptable - I would appreciate it if you could let me know either here, or via private message so that I too can refine my views on this matter).

SINGAPORE (AP) â€” A second Malaysian man due to be hanged in Singapore this week for drug trafficking won a last-minute reprieve Thursday from the top court.

Datchinamurthy Kataiah, 36, was scheduled to be hanged Friday, just two days after the execution of a Malaysian man that sparked an international outcry because he was believed to be mentally disabled.

Lawyer M. Ravi, who earlier represented Datchinamurty, said the Court of Appeal allowed a stay of execution pending a legal challenge on May 20.

Datchchinamurthy is part of a civil case involving 13 death row prisoners who are challenging the prison departmentâ€™s forwarding of copies of their prison correspondence to the attorney generalâ€™s office without their consent, anti-death penalty activist Kirsten Han said.

Ravi and Han said Datchinamurthy represented himself in court Thursday because no lawyer wanted to take the case, fearing reprisals from the government. Lawyers who take on late-stage death row cases are often accused of abusing court processes if they lose and may have to pay hefty costs demanded by the attorney generalâ€™s office, they said.

Datchinamurthy was arrested in 2011 and convicted of trafficking about 45 grams (1.6 ounces) of heroin into Singapore. Fellow Malaysian Nagaenthran K. Dharmalingam was also on death row for over a decade before he was hanged on Wednesday. Singaporeâ€™s government says its use of the death penalty for drug crimes is made clear when people enter the country.

Nagaenthranâ€™s supporters and lawyers said he had an IQ of 69 and was intellectually disabled, and that the execution of a mentally ill person is prohibited under international human rights law.

His case drew pleas from the European Union and global figures including British business magnate Richard Branson to commute his sentence, but Singapore courts ruled he understood his actions at the time of his crime.

Singapore had halted executions for two years because of the COVID-19 pandemic before resuming them with the execution of a drug trafficker in March.",16,0.79,11,0,11,death penalty,t3_udvtqa

[**An alternative way to curtail press freedom**](https://rsf.org/en/singapore)

Singapore has been coloured black on the World Press Freedom Index map since 2020, meaning the situation there is now is classified as â€œvery badâ€. Despite the â€œSwitzerland of the Eastâ€ label often used in government propaganda, the city-state does not fall far short of China when it comes to suppressing media freedom. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loongâ€™s government is always quick to sue critical journalists, apply pressure to make them unemployable, or even force them to leave the country. The Media Development Authority has the power to censor all forms of journalistic content. Defamation suits are common and may sometimes be accompanied by a sedition charge that is punishable by up to 21 years in prison. The political control is coupled with an economic straitjacket. Two business groups control all of Singaporeâ€™s print and broadcast media. One, MediaCorp, is owned by a state investment company. The other, Singapore Press Holdings, is supposedly privately-owned but the government appoints those who run it. As a result, self-censorship is widespread, including within the alternative independent media, which are intimidated by the judicial and economic pressure. The red lines imposed by the authorities, known by Singaporeâ€™s journalists as â€œOB markersâ€ (for out-of-bounds markers), apply to an ever-wider range of issues and public figures. The authorities have also started sending journalists emails threatening them with up to 20 years in prison if they donâ€™t remove annoying articles and fall into line. Finally, the Orwellian provisions of the â€œanti-fake newsâ€ law adopted in 2019 forces all media outlets and digital platforms to post â€œcorrectionsâ€ to any content that the government may arbitrarily deem to be â€œincorrectâ€. This censorship bureau 2.0 has enabled the government to impose its own version on a range of subjects including the death penalty, the salary paid to the prime ministerâ€™s wife, and its handling of the Covid-19 crisis.",92,0.97,72,0,72,death penalty,t3_muo4jf

1. She was accompanying her boyfriend, who was caught drug trafficking; that was about 6 years ago;
2. The sentence was not fair;
3. She was not given a lawyer to defend her case;
4. She had had little help

Her lawyer she engaged recently appealed the Singapore Foreign Ministry for more information.  Among the 8 question asked ,  the lawyer asked if her body will be flown back to Singapore after the death sentence carried out.

Drug trafficking is a death sentence in both Singapore and China.  As there is still very little information about the commitment ,  she should be given  the benefit of doubt until there are more information.

Lets pray that God's mighty hands will help this time if she is really innocent.

With this current case of 5 year old tortured to death AND the [cling wrap roll torture case](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/woman-dies-after-being-physically-tortured-by-couple-for-8-months), I feel like there needs to be something in between the 2 offences. Perhaps something like 'causing grievous hurt leading to death'.

First off, definition of [murder/culpable homicide](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/PC1871#pr299-) and [voluntarily causing grievous hurt](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/PC1871#pr322-). 

**Murder/Culpable homicide:**  *Whoever causes death by doing an act with the* ***intention of causing death****, or with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, or with the knowledge that he is likely by such act to cause death, commits the offence of culpable homicide.* 

**Punishment**: death sentence or life imprisonment + caning

**Voluntarily causing grievous hurt:**  *Whoever voluntarily causes hurt, if the hurt which he intends to cause or knows himself to be likely to cause is grievous hurt, and if the hurt which he causes is grievous hurt, is said â€œvoluntarily to cause grievous hurtâ€.* 

**Punishment**:  Up to 10 years + caning

Note: I'm using murder and culpable homicide interchangeably here because the only times culpable homicide is not murder is when there is provocation/done by a public servant in 'good faith'.

Again, IANAL:

As long as it cannot be proven that the tortures were done with intention to kill, the offenders will never be charged for murder. If the offenders take the victims to hospital/apply first aid, that will almost always show that there is no intention to kill.

So the harshest offence that these offenders can be charged with is voluntarily causing grievous hurt which also covers death at the moment. The maximum punishment is 10 years, which, to me, is seriously lacking.

I really, really do not feel that intentional tortures administered over a long period of time, not caused by provocation should be put on the same level as, for example, serious bar brawls, scuffles, etc. Especially if the victim is vulnerable.

There should be an offence in between, with maximum punishment at, say, 20 years or life imprisonment. I feel that is more appropriate. More just.

If any lawyer reads this and sees mistake in my understanding, please let me know. Thanks.",24,0.73,15,0,15,death sentence,t3_dwjppp

I have found hemp products, especially hemp fibres, being sold by many stores:

Uniqlo SG sells [cotton hemp denim.](https://www.uniqlo.com/sg/en/products/E455480-000?colorCode=COL39&amp;sizeCode=INS029)

Spotlight sells [hemp rope on a spool](https://www.spotlightstores.com/sg/art-craft/basic-craft-supplies/natural-crafts/cord-twine/shamrock-craft-naturals-craft-hemp-rope-spool/80284160?srsltid=AfAwrE7rD3ZvDuPnoQ-qSgsi3igrWC_yj0viAJF2kz45NZqE4Wxgaa8teAg), and Shopee has many sellers which [sell hemp fibre domestically](https://shopee.sg/search?keyword=hemp%20rope&amp;locations=Domestic&amp;noCorrection=true&amp;page=0).

I even found a local aquarium supply store which sells [fish food containing hemp.](https://www.freshnmarine.com/collections/food/products/dupla-gel-o-drops-24-hemp-spirulina), this one is the most egregious one, because it contains hemp seed oils which are technically edible.

I presume that all these products are considered illegal from CNB's point of view. Hence, should these items be reported? At what point does it become ridiculous to prohibit all these products? Can someone be ~~persecuted~~ prosecuted for importing these items? Can someone who drives in to Singapore with a van full of hemp oil fish food be sentenced to death for smuggling cannabis?",54,0.5,0,0,0,death sentence,t3_129nn2s

[The Kranji War Memorial](https://preview.redd.it/lggamijcnfi41.jpg?width=3456&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=84a94b348dc7347fce4b4af98b655a3cb548b5d6)

Before 1939, the Kranji area was a military camp but by 1942, it was the site of a large ammunition magazine. On 8 February 1942, the Japanese crossed the Johore Straits, landing at the mouth of the Kranji river, within two miles of the current Kranji War Memorial. Kranji was turned into a war camp during the Occupation and remained so until after the reoccupation where the small cemetary started by prisoners interned at Kranji was turned into a permanent war cemetery and burials from all over the island were re-concentrated here. 

The Kranji Memorial is now home to over 4,400 white gravestones honouring men from all over the commonwealth who had given their lives up in World War II, some with missing names. There are four large memorials in the cemetery inscribed with the names of over 24,000 Allied soldiers and airmen killed in South East Asia with no known graves. 

Among those remembered here are the fallen men of the Gordon Highlanders, The Manchester Regiment, The Royal Gharwal Rifles,  The 11th Sikh Contingent, The 2nd Punjab Regiment, The 1st KG VSO Gurkha Rifles, The Malay Regiment, The Corps of Royal Indian Engineers, the Straits Settlements Volunteer Force, The Indian States Forces, The Royal Canadian Air Force and many more.

On the Western side of the hill is a small plot called the Gurkha Garden; the Gurkhas of Nepal having served the British army faithfully for 200 years as auxiliary troops. Still known as some of the most fearsome warriors, 110,000 men served in WWII all over the world, from Greece to Singapore. Plot 44 is the Chinese memorial, marking a mass grave of 69 Chinese servicemen. 

Of particular interest on the Memorial grounds are the buried men of Z Special Unit, a naval squadron who mainly worked behind Japanese lines. The unit had carried out several operations sabotaging Japanese warships, notably Operation Rimau. Comprising of men from Britain, Australia, and New Zealand, the Z Special Unit is widely regarded to have had carried out the most successful clandestine military operation in the war - Operation Jaywick, which destroyed 6 Japanese ships.

After carrying out their missions, these men were eventually hunted down and some were imprisoned in Indonesia, some were tortured, some drowned in the sea while trying to escape to Australia and nineteen of them now lie in Kranji. Sworn to secrecy, their daring deeds were never revealed until 1980; even among surviving members of Z Special Unit. Eleven of the men who were captured were imprisoned in Outram Prison, infamous for its dire conditions, one died of malaria in prison. On 7 July 1945, after a trial, ten of the men were sentenced and executed by sword; the Kempetai reported that they went to their deaths laughing.

t3,gz5zdu,singapore,8/6/2020 19:25,casperzero,Anyone else receive this anti-BLM message on whatsapp? I'm not sure if this is propaganda or not. I'm suspicious as to its origin,"&gt; From a Singaporean Chinese living in Singaporeï¼š
&gt; 
&gt; I questioned the white policeâ€™s abuse of blacks, but my American colleague made me think.
&gt; 
&gt; Yesterday, my white American colleague David and I participated in a video conference about the export project. He was late for 30 minutes. After the line connected, he joined the meeting. He explained that it was late because the demonstrations by the people caused traffic jams.
&gt;  
&gt; After the meeting, I specifically asked him not to go offline, so as to chat with him about the unrest in the United States.
&gt; 
&gt; I asked him: Is the United States safe now?  He told me it was safe, I smiled and sent him a few pictures:
&gt; 
&gt; Demonstrators burned the American flag, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; While he was looking at the photos, I asked ridiculously: Is this America safe?  If yes, please do tell me what is unsafe?
&gt;  
&gt; David understood what I meant. He smiled embarrassedly, shrugged, and said: This kind of thing is very common in the United States, but this time someone recorded a video, plus the police did a bit too much. So a large-scale black riot occurred.
&gt;  
&gt; He said it casually, as if nothing unusual had happened.  
&gt; 
&gt; I asked him: Donâ€™t you worry that black people might one day take up arms and retaliate against white people?
&gt;  
&gt; After listening to my words, David gave a hearty laugh. He gave me a grave look. He said to me:
&gt;  
&gt; James (my English name), black people are absolutely afraid to use guns against white people. They are not stupid. What kind of consequences will result from doing so? 
&gt; 
&gt; Black people are very clear about this point.
&gt;  
&gt; Since the establishment of the United States, black people have served white people, and this is what it means for them to live.  In the United States, as long as a white man is killed by a black man, the black man will be sentenced to death or life imprisonment. However, if a white man kills a black man, the probability that the white man will be guilty of murder or manslaughter is very low. The most serious being a fine or a short sentence.
&gt; 
&gt; After hearing what he said, I felt very indignant. I told him: The United States is a country with serious racial discrimination. Apart from white people, any colored people living in the United States have no human rights and are denied.
&gt; 
&gt; David was puzzled and asked me why I was angry.
&gt;  
&gt; I said: I feel sad and indignant for the black man who died tragically under the knee of a white American policeman.
&gt; 
&gt; David listened to me and asked me in a serious tone: Are you really sad about the death of black people?
&gt; 
&gt; I said: Of course, should an innocent person be abused and killed by white policemen, shouldn't he be sympathized?  
&gt; David listened to me, sighed, and then asked me:
&gt;  
&gt; Do you know who has the lowest status in the United States?  
&gt; 
&gt; â€œBlack"", I blurted out.
&gt; 
&gt; He smiled contemptuously and told me point blank: it is the Chinese!
&gt; 
&gt;  Looking at my startled expression, David continued:
&gt;  
&gt; The status of black people in the United States is higher than that of Chinese people, and black people are particularly willing to attack yellow people, especially Chinese students and other Chinese.
&gt;  
&gt; The situation is this: white people despise everyone, and black people despise the Chinese: this is the contempt chain.
&gt;  
&gt; David asked me whether I knew that during this riot, many Chinese shops and Chinese students have become the targets of black attacks?
&gt; 
&gt; I had serious doubts about his remark, because the riot has nothing to do with Chinese or Chinese students.
&gt;  
&gt; He sent me some photos of the riot scene:
&gt; 
&gt; Chinese restaurants and grocery shops lit by demonstrators.
&gt;  
&gt; Even a Chinese student who was a takeaway deliveryman became the target of the demonstrators' attack. His head was seriously injured, his head was dripping with blood, his eyes were smashed, and his life was in serious danger.
&gt; 
&gt; Seeing my glum silence, David went on to say: Black people are the most willing to attack Chinese or Chinese students. When they are angry, unhappy, and need to vent, Chinese often become the target of their attack.  During the previous epidemic, many Chinese and Chinese students were attacked by black people:
&gt; 
&gt; Because the Chinese were wearing masks, a black man hit him with more than 40 punches in the head!
&gt; 
&gt; A black man poured sulfuric acid into the head of a Chinese woman who came out and dumped garbage, causing her terrible burns!
&gt; 
&gt; David told me: James, you are sad for the death of the black people, and you are humbling for them. I really have a hard time understanding.  When black people face white people, they are very pitiful and cowardly, but when they face Chinese or Chinese students, they are different.
&gt;  
&gt; They will never let go of any opportunity to insult or beat your compatriots. Can you understand what I mean?

Not only that, his racism and views on eugenics has guided a number of policies.

The most well example of his support for eugenics is a policy known as the Graduate Mother's scheme in which university graduate women were financially incentivized to have more children and money was offered to poor and uneducated people to be **sterilized** voluntarily:

&gt;Singapore, after serving for two decades as a model for Third World birth control and economic development programs, is now abandoning its earlier population policies in favor of encouraging dramatic population growth. **The initial eugenics-based program introduced in 1984 sought increased fertility for university-educated women and provided major subsidies for the voluntary sterilization of poor and uneducated parents.** These much publicized and internationally discussed programs have now been abandoned in favor of new population programs seeking to encourage fertility in lower as well as better educated groups. A forty percent population increase is being set as a goal. To accomplish this the effective Singapore Family Planning and Population Board has been abolished and Housing Development Board policies are in the process of being reversed to encourage rather than discourage fertility.- [Fertility and Eugenics: Singapore's Population Policies](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40230009)

His Prime Minister's address on the new abortion and voluntary sterilization bill:

&gt;**By introducing this new abortion law together with the companion voluntary sterilization law, we are making possible the exercise of voluntary choice.** But we must keep a close watch on the result of the new laws and the patterns of use which will emerge. It is not unlikely that the people who will want to restrict their families are the better educated parents in better paid jobs. They are the people who already understand that their children's future depends on their being able to care for their health, education and upbringing. **One of the crucial yardsticks by which we shall have to judge the results of the new abortion law combined with the voluntary sterilization law will be whether it tends to raise or lower the total quality of our population.** We must encourage those who earn less than $200 p.m. and cannot afford to nurture and educate many children never to have more than two. Intelligent application of these laws can help reduce the distortion that has already set in. Until the less educated themselves are convinced and realize that they should concentrate their limited resources on one or two to give their children the maximum chance to climb up the education ladder, their children will always be at the bottom of economic scale. It is unlikely that the results will be discernible before five years. Nor will the effect be felt before fifteen to twenty years. But we will regret the time lost, if we do not now take the first tentative steps towards correcting a trend which can leave our society with a large number of the physically, intellectually and culturally anemic. - [**THE PRIME MINISTER'S SPEECH ON THE ABORTION BILL, 29TH DECEMBER, 1969**](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/data/pdfdoc/lky19691229.pdf)

Miscellaneous comments on race and eugenics:

&gt;""If you don't include your women graduates in your breeding pool and leave them on the shelf, you would end up a more stupid society...So what happens? **There will be less bright people to support dumb people in the next generation. That's a problem**."" - **Lee Kuan Yew in 1983 National Day Rally**  
&gt;  
&gt;""The Bell curve is a fact of life. The blacks on average score 85 per cent on IQ and it is accurate, nothing to do with culture. The whites score on average 100. Asians score more â€¦ the Bell curve authors put it at least 10 points higher. These are realities that, if you do not accept, will lead to frustration because you will be spending money on wrong assumptions and the results cannot follow.â€¦  
&gt;  
&gt;**Supposing we had hidden the truth and taken the American approach and said, all men are equal. Then they (The less able or well-off) will demand equal results. And when the results are not equal, they will demand more equal treatment.**"" - [**Lee Kuan Yew: The Man and His Ideas**](https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=0hzjCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT285&amp;dq=%22There+are+deep+and+abiding+differences+between+groups.+And+whatever+we+do,+we+must+remember+that+in+Singapore,+%22&amp;redir_esc=y)  
&gt;  
&gt;""There are deep and abiding differences between groups. And whatever we do, we must remember that in Singapore, the Malays feel they are being asked to compete unfairly, that they are not ready for the competition against the Chinese and the Indians and the Eurasians. **They will not admit or they cannot admit to themselves that, in fact, as a result of history, they are a different gene pool and they do not have these qualities that can enable them to enter the same race.** "" - [**Lee Kuan Yew: The Man and His Ideas**](https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=0hzjCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT285&amp;dq=%22There+are+deep+and+abiding+differences+between+groups.+And+whatever+we+do,+we+must+remember+that+in+Singapore,+%22&amp;redir_esc=y)

&gt;""I started off believing all men were equal â€¦ I now know thatâ€™s the most unlikely thing ever to have been, because millions of years have passed over evolution, people have scattered across the face of this earth, been isolated from each other, developed independently, had different intermixtures between races, peoples, climates, soils."" - [**Lee Kuan Yew: The Man and His Ideas**](https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=0hzjCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT285&amp;dq=%22There+are+deep+and+abiding+differences+between+groups.+And+whatever+we+do,+we+must+remember+that+in+Singapore,+%22&amp;redir_esc=y)

He also didn't trust the common people with the future and success of Singapore, preferring to take a paternalistic approach and centering power in the hands of a few handpicked elites:

&gt;â€œI am often accused of interfering in the private lives of citizens. Yes, if I did not, had I not done that, we wouldnâ€™t be here today. **And I say without the slightest remorse, that we wouldnâ€™t be here, we would not have made economic progress, if we had not intervened on very personal matters â€“ who your neighbor is, how you live, the noise you make, how you spit, or what language you use. We decide what is right. Never mind what the people think.**â€ â€” **Speaking to Straits Times newspaper, 1987**  
&gt;  
&gt;â€œWhen people say, â€˜Oh, ask the people!â€™, itâ€™s childish rubbish ... They say people can think for themselves? Do you honestly believe that the chap who canâ€™t pass primary six knows the consequences of his choice when he answers a questions viscerally on language, culture and religion? ... we would starve, we would have race riots. We would disintegrate.â€â€” [**Lee Kuan Yew: The Man and His Ideas**](https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=0hzjCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT285&amp;dq=%22There+are+deep+and+abiding+differences+between+groups.+And+whatever+we+do,+we+must+remember+that+in+Singapore,+%22&amp;redir_esc=y)

Of course, the man is long passed on but the current Ruling Party is very much the heirs of his legacy and way of thinking. In fact, it just so happens that if you are Lee Kuan Yewâ€™s eldest son you can become Brigadier General after just five years in the army, and six months later you can become a Member of Parliament, and soon after that you can become Deputy Prime Minister.Â  And then become the Prime Minister. And if you are the eldest sonâ€™s wife, you can be put in charge of the state holding company (it holds key interests in 40% of the stock market by market cap).Â  And if youâ€™re Leeâ€™s number-two son, you can run the main Telecoms company.Â 

Now, what are some holdovers that we can attribute to LKY's elitist and materialistic views?

We have a low wage migrant population which have to face discrimination, exploitative employers and are subject to human's rights abuses especially in the pandemic where we locked them down in dormitories with terrible living conditions to contain the spread. They are not treated as human beings, they are treated as subhuman economic units.

Another one of the biggest things, is the justice of this country which seems to be a perverted form of meritocracy. It seems there is one law for the rich and another for the poor and disenfranchised. There have been several high profile cases of university students and scholars committing sexual assault and being given lighter sentences with one of the reasons being given is that they had ""bright futures"". One of them involved a [university student who climbed into his girlfriend's house, and after an argument, strangled her and gouged her eye until it bled](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/nus-student-who-climbed-ex-girlfriends-home-and-strangled-her-gets-short-detention-and-day-reporting-orders-642921).

The same country routinely executes residents and foreignersâ€”disproportionately poor Malay and Indian peopleâ€”for drug-related offenses, in violation of international law. If there EVER was a case for mercy, it would be this recent case, [where Singapore hanged a drug mule with an IQ of 69](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-27/singapore-executes-disabled-malaysian-convicted-in-drug-case). But none was given. In fact, Singapore justified it's decision:

t3,zhjsss,singapore,10/12/2022 5:19,The_Celestrial,World War Z: What happens to Singapore?,"Singaporeâ€™s only mention in the World War Z book is when a Singapore-flagged ship that is beached in India gets snapped in two by another ship that was towing it. According to this [website](https://screenrant.com/world-war-z-2-movie-plot-cancelled-david-fincher/) (might not be trustable), Singapore would have appeared in the cancelled World War Z movie sequel.

After rereading the book for the 3rd time, I decided to make this post because Iâ€™ve got nowhere else to put this story. Here is what I think happened to Singapore in both the book and the movie.

&amp;#x200B;

Movie Timeline, June 2013: Singapore is overrun by zombies very quickly. They swarm us from planes that crashed in Changi Airport or from Malaysia through our 2 land connections. Given how you become a zombie within 10s of being bitten, and that these zombies can run and pile up, there is no way that densely populated Singapore can survive. Small pockets of us that survive will definitely starve or die of thirst by the time the filmâ€™s events have ended.

&amp;#x200B;

Book Timeline: The zombies in the book are traditionally slow zombies, and it takes anywhere from a few hours to several days before you turn into a zombie after being bitten. The zombies can only be killed with a headshot but are otherwise indestructible and don't decay. That gives us a slightly better chance of survival than in the film.

([All international events mentioned below happened in the book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_Z), but all local events are made up by me.)

&amp;#x200B;

2011- Early 2012: The zombie virus emerges in the Three Gorges Dam region of China. As the Chinese government covers it up, Singapore and the rest of the world are unaware of it.

&amp;#x200B;

\~Jan - Mar 2012: The Chinese government initiates a huge crackdown on political dissidents and corruption, which in reality is used to purge the zombie outbreak. Human trafficking brings zombies outside of China to Central Asia, but Singapore is probably fine as weâ€™re not a top smuggling destination.

&amp;#x200B;

\~ Mar - Jun 2012: To deflect international attention, China stages a massive military buildup on Taiwan, creating a crisis. Singapore probably does its usual â€œweâ€™re not taking sides and everyone should calm downâ€ stance. Trafficked infected organs spread the infection worldwide.

&amp;#x200B;

\~ Jun - Aug 2012: The world first properly learns of the zombies when an outbreak begins in a South African slum, however, the zombies are termed â€œAfrican Rabiesâ€. Our local media definitely uses that term for a time and covers it extensively, and our government probably made a statement about SARS and how we are prepared.

Around this time, infected tourists bring the first â€œAfrican Rabiesâ€ cases to Singapore, [making it the first time Singapore had a â€œrabiesâ€ case since 1953.](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/avs/animals/animal-health-and-veterinarians/animal-diseases-and-antimicrobial-resistance/rabies#:~:text=What%20You%20Need%20To%20Know,been%20rabies%20free%20since%201953) Infected patients are obviously not down with rabies, and our healthcare workers probably realise that, but the government sticks to the stance that it is a new strain of rabies, not something else. Videos of infected patients circulate online (probably on STOMP or Facebook).

&amp;#x200B;

\~Sep - Oct 2012: Israel imposes a national quarantine, sealing up their borders, building walls and inviting all Jews and Palestinians to join them (this is the only part of the book that appears in the movie, but the movie version is very different). Given our ties, they might have warned Singapore that something is up with the â€œAfrican Rabiesâ€. The Muslim world (including our neighbours) condemns the move, but Singapore remains silent.

Singapore probably implements SARS-era measures nationwide, with temperature screening, health declarations and PSAs about looking out for the symptoms. Unfortunately, a lot of healthcare workers are gonna get bitten and infected (this is not covered in the books but it definitely happened). Imagine SARS era â€œavoid the healthcare workersâ€ behaviour, but a lot worse now.

The Singapore government might decide to just straight up execute the zombified patients as there is really no hope of saving them (the book doesnâ€™t cover what happens to zombified patients but I assume this is a common practice).

&amp;#x200B;

\~ Nov 2012- Mar 2013: Phalanx, a vaccine for â€œAfrican Rabiesâ€ hits the shelves. Singapore quickly buys stocks of them. However, the vaccine is a placebo and doesnâ€™t work but people donâ€™t realise that. Vaccination centres similar to COVID-19 ones pop up. Although global cases drop due to the northern hemisphere winter, Singapore bans flights from some countries like we did in the early days of COVID.

By this time, an outbreak involving new migrant workers probably happens, and due to their close quarters, it spreads quickly in their dorms. This causes a public outcry over their living conditions.

The worldwide economy starts to slowly recover from the recession caused by the outbreak. In the US, the Republican president wins a second term (in this timeline Obama doesnâ€™t become president) and Singapore congratulations him.

&amp;#x200B;

\~Apr - May 2013: An American newswoman breaks the news that the Phalanx vaccine is a sham and that the â€œAfrican Rabiesâ€ is not a new form of rabies, but is literally zombies. â€œThe Great Panicâ€ ensues.  In Singapore, civil order is a lot better than in other countries, but the worst aspects of our culture emerge, with panic buying, people getting into fights over supplies etc. Singapore probably goes into an ultra-authoritarian, â€œmartial lawâ€ mode, even more authoritarian than in the 60s to 70s.

Reservists are definitely recalled back to maintain civil order and to kill the zombies within the country. Due to our built-up nature, zombies are easily found and killed, as they most likely reanimated in their homes. Riots break out in migrant worker dorms as they demand to go home but the Singapore government suppresses the riots.

All our borders are sealed up, causing chaos at Changi Airport and our border crossings with Malaysia. ([In some WWZ fanfic](https://www.reddit.com/r/imaginarymaps/comments/8ksp8e/cool_map_of_the_world_after_the_events_of_the/), this is how we survive the apocalypse, but the problem is that back in 2013, we imported 90% of our food, about half of our water and all of our energy. We cannot be sealed up forever.)

For the first few weeks of â€œThe Great Panicâ€, the water still flows from Malaysia, ships still pass by, and Indonesia still supplies us with gas, but the government knows this canâ€™t last forever. Ironically, the Singapore navy becomes a â€œpirate fleetâ€, stopping all traffic in the Singapore Strait and seizing all the cargo onboard as the nation is going to need it. The rest of the world devolves into war, Pakistan and Iran have nuked each other and it's likely that Singapore â€œseizesâ€ the gas pipeline from Indonesia and water supply from Malaysia amidst the chaos in those countries.

&amp;#x200B;

\~ Jun 2013 - Jul 2013: After a few weeks of â€œa new normalâ€, Singaporeâ€™s situation becomes untenable. Waves of refugees flood the border crossings and boats attempt to land on our beaches. Zombies start crossing the Johor Straits and walking out of the waves on our beaches (zombies can walk on the sea floor in the book). The SAF is very overstretched trying to guard all of our coasts. Rationing is in place but supplies are running out. Zombies have breached our defences in several places as there are simply too many of them, especially along our northern coast.

Singapore finally devolves into the panic seen in other countries as swarms of zombies flood Singapore from the north and south. The government evacuates to ~~Sentosa~~  Pulau Tekong as it is a lot easier to defend, but that leaves the majority of Singapore to die.

&amp;#x200B;

\~ Aug 2013 - Oct 2013: Singaporeâ€™s 48th birthday passes with the nation effectively gone. The US loses the Battle of Yonkers against a swarm of millions of zombies, while South Korea loses a similar battle at Incheon. Small pockets of survivors live in the abandoned HDBs and other high-rises, which are very easy to defend, but impossible to resupply.

Other countries implement a similar move to Singapore, under a South African plan called the â€œRedeker Planâ€. However, these countries have established â€œsafe zonesâ€ for their populations, which in reality are used as bait to distract the zombies from the real safe zone. Singapore canâ€™t afford to do that due to the inability of any safe zone to sustain itself in our environment.

&amp;#x200B;

\~ Oct 2013 - 2017: For the next 4 years, the ~~Sentosa~~  Tekong Safe Zone ekes out a living on the island. The main goal is to try to outlast the zombies living on Singapore, with the end goal to liberate Singapore in the future. I predict that the forests on ~~Sentosa~~  Tekong are cut down and replaced by farmland, the ~~hotels and resorts are used as housing.~~  bunks for recruits used as housing, while the government has relocated to some of the offices in Ladang Camp. The perimeter of the island is guarded by soldiers who watch out for refugees and zombies walking out of the sea. Singaporeâ€™s 50th birthday arrives in 2015, but only the few thousand on ~~Sentosa~~  Tekong are alive to celebrate it.

In 2017, the Honululu Conference is held on the USS Saratoga, with 72 delegates. It is possible that a Singaporean delegate is among one of them. The US declared that it was going to go on the offensive and liberate the mainland of zombies, with other countries deciding to do so as well. The rest chose not to. Singapore would be among those that abstained, as it did not have the manpower to liberate the mainland.

&amp;#x200B;

2017 - 2020: For the next 3 years, the US liberated its mainland, while other countries did the same. The US was declared liberated in 2020. Afterwards, the US helped to liberate Canada and Mexico.

&amp;#x200B;

2020 - 2022: It is possible that in this timespan, a UN coalition force had liberated Singapore. As Singapore was very urbanised, it probably took a while to clear it of all the zombies hiding among the HDBs and the forests. Imagine BMTâ€™s CQB room clearing but on a nationwide scale.

Victory in China is declared in 2022, although pockets of zombies still remain.

&amp;#x200B;

2032: This is the year that all the interviews in the book are recorded in. The world has been trying to recover from the war, Singapore as well. Of a pre-pandemic population of 5.4 million, I estimate that by this year there are probably only 10,000 remaining. Singapore is freed but mostly empty and abandoned. The remaining Singaporeans are government officials who evacuated to ~~Sentosa~~ Tekong, those who ~~lived on Sentosa,~~ were stationed on Tekong and those who managed to make it there.

&amp;#x200B;

And that concludes this long ass post on Singapore in World War Z. Thanks for making it this far.

Edit: After reading the comments, I have replaced the Sentosa Safe Zone with the Tekong Safe Zone. I suddenly remembered that Tekong had its own reservoir, and the comments have convinced me that Tekong could be defensible after all.",191,0.92,600,0,600,execution,t3_zhjsss

According to Statista there are around 1,000 heroin users in Singapore. According to CNB a heroin user uses 2g of heroin per week. This adds up to a total annual consumption of 104kg in Singapore. Also according to Statista up to 100kg of heroin is seized by the authorities in Singapore each year. 

This would mean that HALF of all heroin trafficked into SG each year is seized. That doesnâ€™t make any sense. (the chance of getting caught is ~50%). So either the Statista info is wrong, or the estimated annual use of heroin is way too low, or the traffickers are extremely bad at trafficking and have a death wish.

t3,zhjsti,SingaporeRaw,10/12/2022 5:19,The_Celestrial,World War Z: What happens to Singapore?,"Singaporeâ€™s only mention in the World War Z book is when a Singapore-flagged ship that is beached in India gets snapped in two by another ship that was towing it. According to this [website](https://screenrant.com/world-war-z-2-movie-plot-cancelled-david-fincher/) (which might not be trustable), Singapore would have appeared in the cancelled World War Z movie sequel.

After rereading the book for the 3rd time, I decided to make this post because Iâ€™ve got nowhere else to put this story. Here is what I think happened to Singapore in both the book and the movie.

&amp;#x200B;

Movie Timeline, June 2013: Singapore is overrun by zombies very quickly. They swarm us from planes that crashed in Changi Airport or from Malaysia through our 2 land connections. Given how you become a zombie within 10s of being bitten, and that these zombies can run and pile up, there is no way that densely populated Singapore can survive. Small pockets of us that survive will definitely starve or die of thirst by the time the filmâ€™s events have ended.

&amp;#x200B;

Book Timeline: The zombies in the book are traditionally slow zombies, and it takes anywhere from a few hours to several days before you turn into a zombie after being bitten. The zombies can only be killed with a headshot but are otherwise indestructible and don't decay. That gives us a slightly better chance of survival than in the film.

([All international events mentioned below happened in the book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_Z), but all local events are made up by me.)

&amp;#x200B;

2011- Early 2012: The zombie virus emerges in the Three Gorges Dam region of China. As the Chinese government covers it up, Singapore and the rest of the world are unaware of it.

&amp;#x200B;

\~Jan - Mar 2012: The Chinese government initiates a huge crackdown on political dissidents and corruption, which in reality is used to purge the zombie outbreak. Human trafficking brings zombies outside of China to Central Asia, but Singapore is probably fine as weâ€™re not a top smuggling destination.

&amp;#x200B;

\~ Mar - Jun 2012: To deflect international attention, China stages a massive military buildup on Taiwan, creating a crisis. Singapore probably does its usual â€œweâ€™re not taking sides and everyone should calm downâ€ stance. Trafficked infected organs spread the infection worldwide.

&amp;#x200B;

\~ Jun - Aug 2012: The world first properly learns of the zombies when an outbreak begins in a South African slum, however, the zombies are termed â€œAfrican Rabiesâ€. Our local media definitely uses that term for a time and covers it extensively, and our government probably made a statement about SARS and how we are prepared.

Around this time, infected tourists bring the first â€œAfrican Rabiesâ€ cases to Singapore, [making it the first time Singapore had a â€œrabiesâ€ case since 1953.](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/avs/animals/animal-health-and-veterinarians/animal-diseases-and-antimicrobial-resistance/rabies#:~:text=What%20You%20Need%20To%20Know,been%20rabies%20free%20since%201953) Infected patients are obviously not down with rabies, and our healthcare workers probably realise that, but the government sticks to the stance that it is a new strain of rabies, not something else. Videos of infected patients circulate online (probably on STOMP or Facebook).

&amp;#x200B;

\~Sep - Oct 2012: Israel imposes a national quarantine, sealing up their borders, building walls and inviting all Jews and Palestinians to join them (this is the only part of the book that appears in the movie, but the movie version is very different). Given our ties, they might have warned Singapore that something is up with the â€œAfrican Rabiesâ€. The Muslim world (including our neighbours) condemns the move, but Singapore remains silent.

Singapore probably implements SARS-era measures nationwide, with temperature screening, health declarations and PSAs about looking out for the symptoms. Unfortunately, a lot of healthcare workers are gonna get bitten and infected (this is not covered in the books but it definitely happened). Imagine SARS era â€œavoid the healthcare workersâ€ behaviour, but a lot worse now.

The Singapore government might decide to just straight up execute the zombified patients as there is really no hope of saving them (the book doesnâ€™t cover what happens to zombified patients but I assume this is a common practice).

&amp;#x200B;

\~ Nov 2012- Mar 2013: Phalanx, a vaccine for â€œAfrican Rabiesâ€ hits the shelves. Singapore quickly buys stocks of them. However, the vaccine is a placebo and doesnâ€™t work but people donâ€™t realise that. Vaccination centres similar to COVID-19 ones pop up. Although global cases drop due to the northern hemisphere winter, Singapore bans flights from some countries like we did in the early days of COVID.

By this time, an outbreak involving new migrant workers probably happens, and due to their close quarters, it spreads quickly in their dorms. This causes a public outcry over their living conditions.

The worldwide economy starts to slowly recover from the recession caused by the outbreak. In the US, the Republican president wins a second term (in this timeline Obama doesnâ€™t become president) and Singapore congratulations him.

&amp;#x200B;

\~Apr - May 2013: An American newswoman breaks the news that the Phalanx vaccine is a sham and that the â€œAfrican Rabiesâ€ is not a new form of rabies, but is literally zombies. â€œThe Great Panicâ€ ensues.  In Singapore, civil order is a lot better than in other countries, but the worst aspects of our culture emerge, with panic buying, people getting into fights over supplies etc. Singapore probably goes into an ultra-authoritarian, â€œmartial lawâ€ mode, even more authoritarian than in the 60s to 70s.

Reservists are definitely recalled back to maintain civil order and to kill the zombies within the country. Due to our built-up nature, zombies are easily found and killed, as they most likely reanimated in their homes. Riots break out in migrant worker dorms as they demand to go home but the Singapore government suppresses the riots.

All our borders are sealed up, causing chaos at Changi Airport and our border crossings with Malaysia. ([In some WWZ fanfic](https://www.reddit.com/r/imaginarymaps/comments/8ksp8e/cool_map_of_the_world_after_the_events_of_the/), this is how we survive the apocalypse, but the problem is that back in 2013, we imported 90% of our food, about half of our water and all of our energy. We cannot be sealed up forever.)

For the first few weeks of â€œThe Great Panicâ€, the water still flows from Malaysia, ships still pass by, and Indonesia still supplies us with gas, but the government knows this canâ€™t last forever. Ironically, the Singapore navy becomes a â€œpirate fleetâ€, stopping all traffic in the Singapore Strait and seizing all the cargo onboard as the nation is going to need it. The rest of the world devolves into war, Pakistan and Iran have nuked each other and it's likely that Singapore â€œseizesâ€ the gas pipeline from Indonesia and water supply from Malaysia amidst the chaos in those countries.

&amp;#x200B;

\~ Jun 2013 - Jul 2013: After a few weeks of â€œa new normalâ€, Singaporeâ€™s situation becomes untenable. Waves of refugees flood the border crossings and boats attempt to land on our beaches. Zombies start crossing the Johor Straits and walking out of the waves on our beaches (zombies can walk on the sea floor in the book). The SAF is very overstretched trying to guard all of our coasts. Rationing is in place but supplies are running out. Zombies have breached our defences in several places as there are simply too many of them, especially along our northern coast.

Singapore finally devolves into the panic seen in other countries as swarms of zombies flood Singapore from the north and south. The government evacuates to ~~Sentosa~~  Pulau Tekong as it is a lot easier to defend, but that leaves the majority of Singapore to die.

&amp;#x200B;

\~ Aug 2013 - Oct 2013: Singaporeâ€™s 48th birthday passes with the nation effectively gone. The US loses the Battle of Yonkers against a swarm of millions of zombies, while South Korea loses a similar battle at Incheon. Small pockets of survivors live in the abandoned HDBs and other high-rises, which are very easy to defend, but impossible to resupply.

Other countries implement a similar move to Singapore, under a South African plan called the â€œRedeker Planâ€. However, these countries have established â€œsafe zonesâ€ for their populations, which in reality are used as bait to distract the zombies from the real safe zone. Singapore canâ€™t afford to do that due to the inability of any safe zone to sustain itself in our environment.

&amp;#x200B;

\~ Oct 2013 - 2017: For the next 4 years, the ~~Sentosa~~  Tekong Safe Zone ekes out a living on the island. The main goal is to try to outlast the zombies living on Singapore, with the end goal to liberate Singapore in the future. I predict that the forests on ~~Sentosa~~  Tekong are cut down and replaced by farmland, the ~~hotels and resorts are used as housing.~~  bunks for recruits used as housing, while the government has relocated to some of the offices in Ladang Camp. The perimeter of the island is guarded by soldiers who watch out for refugees and zombies walking out of the sea. Singaporeâ€™s 50th birthday arrives in 2015, but only the few thousand on ~~Sentosa~~  Tekong are alive to celebrate it.

In 2017, the Honululu Conference is held on the USS Saratoga, with 72 delegates. It is possible that a Singaporean delegate is among one of them. The US declared that it was going to go on the offensive and liberate the mainland of zombies, with other countries deciding to do so as well. The rest chose not to. Singapore would be among those that abstained, as it did not have the manpower to liberate the mainland.

&amp;#x200B;

2017 - 2020: For the next 3 years, the US liberated its mainland, while other countries did the same. The US was declared liberated in 2020. Afterwards, the US helped to liberate Canada and Mexico.

&amp;#x200B;

2020 - 2022: It is possible that in this timespan, a UN coalition force had liberated Singapore. As Singapore was very urbanised, it probably took a while to clear it of all the zombies hiding among the HDBs and the forests. Imagine BMTâ€™s CQB room clearing but on a nationwide scale.

Victory in China is declared in 2022, although pockets of zombies still remain.

&amp;#x200B;

2032: This is the year that all the interviews in the book are recorded in. The world has been trying to recover from the war, Singapore as well. Of a pre-pandemic population of 5.4 million, I estimate that by this year there are probably only 10,000 remaining. Singapore is freed but mostly empty and abandoned. The remaining Singaporeans are government officials who evacuated to ~~Sentosa~~ Tekong, those who ~~lived on Sentosa,~~ were stationed on Tekong and those who managed to make it there.

&amp;#x200B;

t3,s2uyjf,SingaporeRaw,13/1/2022 8:52,TsaiJack0,Man jailed for abetting conspiracy to rape colleague's wife,"SINGAPORE: After about two years of discussing wife-sharing fantasies with a colleague, a man went to his colleague's home at his invitation and attempted to rape his unconscious wife.

The woman's three children and domestic helper were asleep in another room when this went on. However, as he was predisposed to erectile dysfunction, he was unable to complete the act.


The 47-year-old man, who cannot be named as this could lead to the victim being identified, was sentenced on Thursday (Jan 13) to three years' jail.

He pleaded guilty to one charge of abetment of conspiracy to commit rape, where the rape did not occur. A second charge of outrage of modesty was taken into consideration.

The court heard that the accused, a sales manager, got to know the victim's husband A2 in 2010 when he supplied goods to A2's workplace.

In 2015, the accused became A2's colleague, and they became close. A2 started sharing details of his sex life with the accused, as well as his wife-sharing fantasies. Subsequently, A2 broached the idea of the accused
A2 married his wife in 1994 and has three children of school-going age with her, the court heard.


In August 2017, A2 contacted the accused and said his wife was ready. He never told the accused that his wife had consented to sex with him, and the accused never asked if she had consented.

In truth, A2's wife neither agreed to the accused going to her house nor to having sex with him.

THE VICTIM WAS UNCONSCIOUSâ€‹

Past midnight on Sep 1, 2017, A2 gave the accused access to his home and bedroom. His wife was unconscious on the bed after A2 had given her alcohol and a drug.

He then asked the accused to have sex with his wife while A2 watched. The accused molested the victim and tried to rape her but was unable to.

As the victim began to regain consciousness, she realised someone other than her husband was attempting sex with her and removed the blindfold that her husband had earlier put on her.
The accused fled.

The victim later insisted that both the accused and A2 write confession letters, which the accused did.

In his letter, the accused said he was in the house for five to eight minutes and was told by A2 that all was okay, but he then found out that the victim did not know about it and was unconscious.

He was later assessed for erectile dysfunction and was found to be predisposed to it.

AN APPALLING CASE: PROSECUTORâ€‹

Deputy Public Prosecutor Chee Ee Ling asked for between two and three-and-a-half years' jail. The accused had earlier been convicted in July 2018 of nine charges, including the sale of obscene books, insulting modesty and possessing uncensored and obscene films. He was given 12 weeks' jail and fined S$20,000.

Ms Chee said this is ""an appalling case"" where the accused conspired with A2 to rape A2's wife. Fortunately, the victim regained consciousness before the accused could complete the rape.
There are four aggravating factors, she said - premeditation and planning, the presence of a vulnerable victim, exposure to harm in the form of sexual disease or pregnancy, and attempted rape in the victim's home.

The premeditation is ""clear"", said Ms Chee. The two men discussed their ""devious plan"" for about two years before executing it, and the accused's role is ""pivotal"" to the enactment of A2's ""deviant sexual fantasy"".

""He was as invested as A2 in the fulfilment of A2's sexual fantasies,"" she said.

The victim was unconscious, naked and blindfolded and unable to resist any advances or in any state to give consent, said Ms Chee.

There was also a risk of pregnancy from pre-ejaculation fluids, even though there was no full penetration, she said. The act was committed in the victim's home, with an intrusion into her safe space that ""destroyed her personal sense of safety and security"".

The accused was convicted over a similar ""perverse incident"" in 2016. Although the current offences were not detected at the time of his conviction in July 2018, he escalated his offending and went on to conspire to rape
A2 PLANNED IT: DEFENCEâ€‹

Defence lawyer Nakoorsha Abdul Kadir asked instead for between two and two-and-a-half years' jail, the lower end of the range the prosecution sought.

He pointed to his client's early plea of guilt, letter of apology after the offence and cooperation with authorities.

He said although his client did have a previous conviction for sexual crimes, it was not as though he was ""convicted, served his sentence, came out and reoffended"".

He said it was not entirely true that his client and A2 planned the offence for about two years. Instead, they were ""basically sharing wife-sharing fantasies"".

He added that it was A2 who was ""planning the whole thing"", while his client ""went along for the ride"".

The judge noted that the attempted rape occurred in the victim's matrimonial home, with exploitation of a space that should have been safe for the family members.
The accused could have been sentenced to a maximum of five years' jail for his offence. He is the first man to be sentenced in this case. Another six men are involved in a broader scheme of wife-sharing that resulted in alleged sex crimes.

The cases came to light after one of their wives found explicit photos in her husband's phone and lodged a police report.

Four men, including A2, are set to plead guilty to their offences next month. A fifth man intends to claim trial, while the position of the sixth man is not clear at this point.

The 24-year-old Singaporean delivered a surprise gold at the Badminton World Federation World Championships on Sunday when he beat India's Kidambi Srikanth 21-15, 22-20 in the men's singles final in Huelva, Spain, despite nursing an ankle injury.

Returning with national singles coach Kelvin Ho and physiotherapist Ho Jia Ying, he also celebrated his climb to a career-high world No. 15 in the latest rankings released on Tuesday.

National swimmer Joseph Schooling had received a similar reception when heÂ returned from the Rio 2016 Olympics with the nation's first Olympic gold medalÂ after winning the men's 100-metre butterfly final.

Due to Covid-19 safe management measures, there was no public reception for the shuttler.

Once Loh clears a polymerase chain reaction swab test, he will be welcomed home by Edwin Tong, Minister for Culture, Community and Youth, as well as Singapore Badminton Association officials - president Lawrence Leow, chief executive officer Alan Ow, technical director Martin Andrew and other management committee members.

He will then attend a press conference at the Changi Experience Studio in Jewel.

With the exception of a four-day spell at home from Dec 4-7, Loh has been on the road since August to train and compete.

HeÂ had a one-month training stint with Denmark's world No. 1 and Olympic champion Viktor AxelsenÂ and four other

top-60 players in Dubai across August and September, before he flew to Paris to train with the France national team.

In the two months that followed, he captured the Dutch Open and Hylo Open in Germany and finished second in the Indonesia Open, before claiming his historic world title.In the process, he scalped six of the current top 10 players - Axelsen, Japan's Kento Momota (second), Denmark's Anders Antonsen (third), Chinese Taipei's Chou Tien-chen (fourth), Malaysia's Lee Zii Jia (seventh), and Kidambi (10th).
